Joining the federal and state governments, the commission voted and approved the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic at a special called meeting on Tues.

During the meeting, the Escambia County commission and other elected county officials considered the closure. “First thing is to recognize this is unchartered territory. This is a challenge that is facing the county, the state, the country—well it’s the world, and in our lifetimes we have not had this type of outbreak of a virus to deal with. No one really knows exactly what the best thing to do is, but the best thing you can do is err on the side of precaution,” said County Administrator Tony Sanks. Sanks explained that the closure is simply out of precaution; as of right now there are no confirmed cases in the county.

The preventative measure is to ensure the health and safety of all residents and employees. The decision did not come without thorough consideration. Consulting with every head of office in the courthouse before and during the meeting, the commission considered the benefits to closing now in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.

“This virus does not pay attention to state and county lines. It is easily transmittable and it is something we really need to pay attention to,” said Sanks.

Meeting with other county commissioners throughout the state on Mon., Chairman Karean Reynolds shared an update from the Association of County Commissions of Alabama.

“We had an Alabama Association County Commission meeting yesterday. The Gov. gave a report from our task force on this particular topic. The CDC website had 36 confirmed cases this afternoon in the state. Throughout the state of Ala. 40% of our hospital beds are being used. The CDC recommended that you do not engage in social gatherings of 20, the President took it to 10,” said Reynolds.

With these facts in hand, Reynolds and the commission reached out to elected officials for guidance in the matter.

“I want to thank our elected officials for working on this with us. Thank you for giving of your time to help us make this difficult decision,” said Reynolds.

Addressing the room about the rapidly changing climate surrounding the virus, Sanks explained the great need for social distancing. “Today, the surgeon general said that we have the same number of cases today as Italy did two weeks ago. If we don’t take big measures now, in two weeks where will we be? I think it is important to make every effort you can to reduce contact with the public and with our employees.”

Following the recommendations by elected officials, the CDC, state and federal governments, the commission deemed it in the best interest of the citizens of Escambia County to close the courthouse and declare a state of emergency.

With this declaration the following will go into effect:

Escambia County facilities shall be closed to the public through April 5, 2020. The Chairman, Vice Chairman, and County Administrator are hereby authorized to execute the necessary contracts, agreements, and other documents necessary for the continuity of government under the provisions of the Code of Alabama , §31-9-10(b). The Sheriff’s Office, County Jail, Emergency Management, County Commission & Administration, ECATS, Agency on Aging and Road Department & Engineering are departments providing essential services to the public or support services and shall continue to operate. All employees will continue to be paid during the time that the county facilities are closed.

During the closure, the court system of Ala. will remain open; however, all in-person trials have been suspended until next month. Residents will still be able to contact local officials. Contact information will be posted on the door of the courthouse. The contact information is listed below for all individuals needing assistance during the closure.

Despite no results showing the pandemic has been detected in Etowah County as of Tuesday, a resolution passed by the commission states that the health emergency has or will imminently threaten the county.

A number of local municipalities also issued emergency proclamations in support of the county’s declaration.

The county’s resolution allows the commission to “waive procedure and formalities otherwise required by law pertaining to the performance of public work, entering into contracts, the incurring of obligations, the employment of temporary workers and the purchase and distribution with or without compensation of supplies, materials and facilities, and the appropriation and expenditure of public funds.”

The resolution was passed in an effort to limit the number of meetings needed during the emergency while still giving the county the authority to continue to conduct business.

Through the resolution, commissioners could discuss matters without reaching a physical quorum, including via phone or video conferencing. Commissioners could not vote on actions without a quorum, but action could be taken in an emergency without a vote.

Commissioners approved the resolution during a regular meeting after discussing the ongoing coronavirus situation during a work session held beforehand.

Local municipalities including Gadsden, Rainbow City, Attalla and Glencoe passed resolutions declaring local emergencies on Tuesday. Hokes Bluff was expected to pass a similar resolution during a meeting later Tuesday evening. Southside’s City Council is not expected to meet until next week.

The proclamations from the municipalities offered support to the county, while also acknowledging that extra steps could be taken to ensure that essential services could continue within each city during the emergency.

The declarations stem from Section 31 of the Alabama Code, which lays out emergency management organizations and the powers of local governments during an emergency.

Under the law, municipalities and local governments are able to prepare for emergencies by developing emergency management plans, providing rescue teams and other emergency management workers, establishing control centers to serve as command posts during an emergency and more.

During an emergency, though, the municipality or county can waive some procedures pertaining to the performance of public work to react quickly in times of need. They also are authorized to close any and all public buildings under their control or impose a public safety curfew.

Many municipalities have already begun closing city halls, public libraries and other facilities in response to the coronavirus in an effort to impede its spreading, and the county has postponed some court hearings while working to ensure that the courthouse could remain open to the public for matters that require coming to the courthouse.

Still, commissioners and Chief Administrative Officer Shane Ellison urged the public to utilize online services for driver’s license renewals, car tag renewals, mobile home renewals, recordings and property tax information, amongst other available services.

They also discussed restricting entrance to the courthouse to the ADA-compliant entrances on the south and west sides of the building, where hand sanitizer or hand washing stations will be available. The courthouse also plans to ask those who enter who show signs of illness to leave the facility.

After declaring the state of emergency, the commission agreed to plan not to meet until its next scheduled public meeting on April 7. Should action be required before then, an emergency meeting likely would be called.",103931,2020-03-19

ST. CLAIR COUNTY — The St. Clair County Commission declared a State of Local Emergency on Monday in response to the growing threat of the coronavirus.

St. Clair County Commission Chair Paul Manning signed the authorization as the coronavirus could impact the health, safety and economy of the people of the county.

The declaration allows the county to waive procedures and formalities typically needed. This includes:

Performance of public work and taking whatever prudent action is necessary to ensure health, safety and welfare of the community.

Entering into contracts.

Incurring obligations.

Employment of temporary workers.

Utilization of volunteer workings.

Rental equipment.

Acquisition and distribution, with or without compensation, of supplies, materials and facilities.

Appropriation of expenditure of public funds.

This precedes Jefferson County banning gatherings of 25 or more people. In addition, nursing homes will now ban visitors, restaurants, bars and brewers will be pickup or delivery only for one week. Starting Thursday, all private schools will be closed until April 6.

As of Monday afternoon, there were 29 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Alabama. Seventeen of those confirmed cases were in Jefferson County. There are still no deaths associated with the outbreak in the state.

Earlier in the day, the Alabama Department of Public Health urged people to avoid gatherings of more than 50 people, unless they can maintain a 6-foot distance between others, to limit spread of the coronavirus outbreak.

The advice follows guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, State Health Officer Scott Harris said.

Harris said restaurants are urged to keep a 6-foot (2-meter) distance between tables and limit admittance to 50% of capacity. Harris said people attending weddings and funerals should also try to maintain 6-foot (2-meter) distance. He said workplaces may not be able to maintain the distances but should try whenever possible.

Senior citizens, and those with health problems, should be more careful, Harris said. Senior adults or those with chronic health problems should avoid gatherings, outside of close family, of 10 or more people, and should avoid travel by air, train or bus, the state health department said.

“I think if we all cooperate, if we all manage to do this then we will have a little bit of time where we are inconvenienced and uncomfortable but I know we will come out OK on the other side,” Harris said.

For most people, coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. People with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover, according to the World Health Organization.",86308,2020-03-19

Apache Junction declared a state of emergency on Friday after announcing temporary closures of its library and other city facilities earlier in the week to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.

“We don’t want anyone to be alarmed,” Mayor Jeff Serdy said in a written release. “This just allows the city to access funds if there are federal funds that are allocated.”

Apache Junction is a community of more than 40,000 residents that crosses over from Maricopa County into Pinal County.

""We want to protect our citizens and visitors during this serious situation, and this is the most prudent way to address it at this time,"" Serdy said.

Serdy encouraged residents to follow CDC recommendations to avoid large groups and stay home.

What's closed and open in Apache Junction

The library is closed, but residents can continue to use online services.

The Apache Junction Multi-Generational Center closed indefinitely, and all city classes and fitness programs have been suspended through the end of the month.

The city has temporarily suspended senior programs, including in-person dining, at the multi-generational center. Meals will be supplied to seniors on a drive-thru basis and by delivery.

City-run special events are suspended through the end of March.

Refunds of registration fees or facility reservations and membership suspensions will be offered as requested.

The Apache Junction Water District issued a temporary moratorium on water service disconnections during the pandemic. It encourages residents who can make a payment to do so online, by mail or at one of the city's dropbox locations.

Other city operations, including the City Clerk's Office and Development Services Department, remain open.

City crews will increase their cleaning schedule for public buildings and sanitize high-touch areas.

“I urge citizens to remain calm,” she said.

At the same time, she declared a state of emergency in the county, mostly, as she explained, to free up access to federal and state funds in the event they are needed.

“The good news is we have no positive reports [of coronavirus] in Mohave County,” Bishop said.

It is a fair assumption, though, that the virus is already in the community, County’s Public Health Director Denise Burley said. She advised the public to visit the Public Health Department’s website (https://bit.ly/2x95T8a) and Facebook for daily updates.

As of March 18, the county had conducted 12 tests with no positive results reported, said county Public Health Nursing Services Manager Lynne Valentine.

“Our testing capability is limited, as it is throughout the state,” Burley said.

There are no immediate plans to arrange mass testing sites, she continued. To be tested, one must still demonstrate both symptoms and exposure, like a recent travel or a contact with a coronavirus carrier. If someone in the county would test positive, their whole family would be asked to stay home, Burley said.

Mohave County Emergency Coordinator Mike Browning said elements of a county Emergency Operation Center have already activated and the county is prepared to move to full-scale operation, if needed.

Friday, March 20, will bring another important meeting, Bishop said. The county will be deciding on further closures, such as libraries or less essential departments. The future of local small businesses, and employees in the county who have already lost their jobs, will be discussed.

Workers are particularly affected in Laughlin, Nevada, and Bullhead City, after casinos and businesses in Clark County, Nevada closed after that county reported its first coronavirus death.

“We’re doing everything possible to address the crisis,” Supervisor Gary Watson of District 1 said. “We’ll get through this. Remain calm and faithful to your government. … Use common sense.”",203030,2020-03-20

Yuma County issues declaration of emergency on COVID-19.

Yuma County has officially issued a declaration of emergency over COVID-19. Yuma County Supervisor Board Chairman Tony Reyes says board members approved the declaration this morning. Reyes says the Board’s decision was made as a proactive reaction to a serious public health threat.

""We’re trying to get ahead of this to be able to assure the public that the county and the department, the health department of the county, and every employee of the county is ready to take care of our residents, of our public,"" Reyes said Friday. ""And we want to make sure, if need be, and actions need to be taken that are drastic, we’ll be able to do that.""

Diana Gomez, director of the Yuma County Public Health Services District, assured the public that even though an emergency declaration has been made, there is no reason for anyone to panic.

""As of this moment, and it’s a rapidly evolving situation, there is no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Yuma County,"" Gomez said. ""When we become aware of a confirmed case we will notify the public.""

Gomez added that at this time there are also no “presumed cases” of COVID-19. She said a presumed case is when someone is believed to be showing symptoms of the virus, but test results have not yet confirmed it.

Gomez says that as testing becomes readily available, more cases will be discovered. She says that does not mean there is more disease in the county, but rather that more people infected are being discovered.

Officials reiterated that the best thing people can do to protect themselves is to wash their hands often and stay away from situations where they can be exposed.

Public health officials on Sunday announced five new cases of coronavirus in Northern California, including three new cases in Santa Clara County, and two health workers who were likely infected while exposed to a patient in Solano County.

The two Bay Area health care workers are ""presumptive positive"" with COVID-19 coronavirus, the Alameda County Health Department reported on Sunday. A presumptive positive case is a person who tested positive by a public health laboratory and is pending confirmatory testing at the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention.

Both patients are NorthBay VacaValley Hospital health care workers and are currently in isolation at home; one is a Solano County resident, the other is an Alameda County resident, according to health officials. Both also had exposure to the community-acquired case currently hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. The woman in the initial case is slowly recovering, health officials said, and her family members had negative test results for COVID-19 so far and remain in quarantine.

“In her stay there of several days, there were many health care workers who came into contact with her,"" said Solano County Health Officer Dr. Bela Matyas. ""We were aware of that once we learned about her situation, North Bay hospital and public health officials very aggressively identified everyone who could have possibly had contact with her and then quarantined them.""

Maytas added the ""good news is that the ill health care workers, none of them are ill enough to require hospitalization.""

Public health and hospital staff said they quickly identified all health care workers in contact with the person during his or her hospitalization. All of those health care workers remain in isolation or in quarantine and will not return to patient care until they are cleared, the health department said.

The announcement also brought Santa Clara County’s total to seven cases of the new virus, known officially as novel coronavirus or COVID-19, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department said Sunday evening.

The fifth case involves an adult woman with chronic health conditions who was hospitalized. The sixth and seventh cases involve a husband and wife who recently traveled to Egypt. The husband has chronic health conditions, and the couple is currently hospitalized, according to the department.

“We understand that the evolving news about COVID-19 is concerning, and we are taking the situation very seriously. This news is not unexpected in the Bay Area, and we are ready for cases here. This is not the time to panic; now is the time for all of us to work together."" — Dr. Erica Pan, Health Officer, Alameda County Public Health Department.

A full contact investigation is underway for the two new health care worker cases, and individuals potentially exposed are in the process of being identified and evaluated.

Teams of epidemiologists from the CDC and California Department of Public Health are helping the health departments in tracing those who may be at risk for exposure because of the new cases.

Alameda County and Solano County Public Health Departments are monitoring these new cases’ conditions as well as their contacts for symptoms.

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have experienced mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Similar to the flu, it appears to cause less severe illness in younger people; those with more severe impacts tend to be older, medically fragile individuals with underlying medical conditions.

The new guidelines came as the county's Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency in the county to deal with the potential spread of the new coronavirus, or COVID-19.

As of Tuesday, a total of 10 Contra Costa County residents have tested positive for the new coronavirus. Of those, four were known to have had contact with people who previously tested positive. Six had no recent history of travel outside the United States or known contact with a confirmed case. In addition, three confirmed cases from outside Contra Costa have been treated at hospitals in the county.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person, not only in Contra Costa County. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

To slow the spread locally, officials with the county's public health department, Contra Costa Health Services, were scheduled to announce new public guidance in a briefing at 2 p.m. Tuesday. [Officials with CCHS said the briefing would be live-streamed on Contra Costa Health Services' Facebook page at 2 p.m. but it appears the video was delayed; if it becomes available we will share it here.]

The new guidelines are in addition to those released Friday by the county for people 50 and older, as well as people of all ages who suffer from serious illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung disease or immunosuppression. Friday, the at-risk community members were advised to avoid mass gatherings, such as parades, sporting events or concerts.



""CCHS is releasing updated health guidance to protect the community from novel coronavirus (COVID-19),"" CCHS Spokesman Karl Fischer said Tuesday. ""The updated guidance includes specific actions recommended for people at high risk of severe disease, community gatherings, businesses and employers, schools, public transit and the general public.""

Organizers are encouraged to cancel or postpone events for, or attended by, older adults or others who are at higher risk for severe illness. Those considered at higher risk are people 50 or older, as current evidence indicates that the risk of severe illness from the new coronavirus increases with age; and people of any age who have underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or chronic lung diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

In adopting the emergency proclamation Tuesday, Board of Supervisors Chair Candace Andersen, said: ""The new coronavirus or COVID-19 presents our community with a challenge. While I urge you to be prepared, it is certainly not a time to panic. Following our health officials' guidelines will help prevent the spread of disease. The County and Contra Costa Health Services will continue to offer guidance and resources. Meanwhile, there is much each and everyone one of us can do to keep our families and communities well. It will take all of us working together.""

In voting unanimously in favor of the county emergency proclamation, supervisors said ""everyone plays an important role.""

The proclamation, the board said, will help the health department mobilize county resources, accelerate emergency planning, streamline staffing, coordinate agencies across the county, allow for future reimbursement by the state and federal governments, and raise awareness about how everyone can prepare in the event COVID-19 begins to spread in the community.

""The County and its health department will continue to work with multiple agencies and jurisdictions to keep residents informed during this local emergency,"" County Administrator David Twa said. ""We will continue to take appropriate steps to protect the safety and well being of our employees and the public. We encourage everyone to stay prepared.""",1094205,2020-03-12

El Dorado County on Thursday joined dozens of other California counties and cities to declare a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak, ensuring resources and funding are available to slow the spread of COVID-19.

There were not any confirmed COVID-19 cases in El Dorado County on Thursday afternoon, according to a news release. All COVID-19 tests conducted in the county have been negative.

But officials there say it was appropriate to declare a public health emergency due to confirmed cases in the region and the high likelihood that El Dorado County will have a confirmed case at some point soon.

“It is a prerequisite for requesting and receiving any available federal or state funding and will allow us access to the resources necessary to keep people as safe as possible and lessen disease transmission in El Dorado County,” Dr. Nancy Williams, the county’s public health officer, said in the release.

Within hours of the state’s first reported death due to COVID-19 complications last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus. Sacramento, Placer and Yolo counties have done the same.

El Dorado County officials said Thursday’s declaration allows them to provide or receive mutual aid from other jurisdictions and helps in open up resources, mutual aid and staffing.

The county continues to work closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and California Department of Public Health on coordinated testing, investigations and guidance and help to health care providers. The joint efforts also include monitoring for acute respiratory illness and gathering information to detect new cases for lab testing and confirming infection.

El Dorado public health officials were encouraging local facilities, such as long-term care and nursing facilities that have elderly and frail residents, to create procedures that include limiting and screening visitors, and daily monitoring. They also have been encouraged to consulting with public health officials.

Following guidance from state officials, El Dorado’s Public Health agency was not recommending that local school districts close campuses Thursday, except for postponing or canceling non-essential large gatherings. Officials said the county also was considering limiting non-essential meetings and gatherings, but any specific details will be announced as they are developed.

Williams said the risk of transmission for COVID-19 remains low for the public. But she also said it’s important for people to notify their healthcare provider to determine whether testing is needed if they have respiratory symptoms and have traveled to a country with active COVID-19 within the last 14 days or if they have been in close contact with a person to have lab-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.

The Fresno County Board of Supervisors declared the novel coronavirus an official emergency Tuesday, following recommendations from federal and state officials, but at least one supervisor said it’s an overreaction.

In two separate votes, the supervisors gave the county’s emergency director and its health officer the power to pursue state and federal emergency funds as they become available.

Officials announced the emergency earlier in the week but Tuesday’s vote during a special meeting made it official. The county began monitoring the virus after it first showed in China, according to David Pomaville, director of the county Public Health Department.

“I think this is going to be with us for a while,” he said. “I assure you every week we’ll see some changes.”

Two Fresno County men have tested positive for the coronavirus, also called COVID-19, officials said on Sunday.

The first was a man older than 65 who had been on a Grand Princess cruise; the second was described as a middle-aged man who had traveled abroad. Both are recovering and have been instructed to self-quarantine, according to county health officials.

Declaring a state of emergency also will give the county flexibility in managing its approximately 7,000 employees, many who have families dealing with school closures, according to Fresno County Administrative Officer Jean Rousseau.

Library shutdown

The county will begin shutting down its libraries due to recommendations to keep gatherings to 10 people or fewer, Rousseau said. Officials are also assessing which employees can work from home and which must interact with the public.

“We still have services to provide,” he said. “We just have to be very careful how we do that.”

Tax season is also ramping up as April approaches. Officials said sending checks in the mail is the safest way to pay taxes for the public and for public employees.

Some industries, like those in the agricultural sector, will continue to operate through the emergency, officials noted. Producing food can’t come to a halt for several weeks, according to Supervisor Brian Pacheco, who is a dairyman.

“We don’t have a choice,” he said. “We have to milk, feed and water the animals every day.”

County officials say they are working with farmers to make sure their work force is being monitored and ensure they are allowed time off, if they need it.

Brandau: Many are alarmist

Though county officials were urging the precautionary measures, Supervisor Steve Brandau said many public officials were being alarmist.

“I think that many in government and in our society have been overreacting to the Chinese coronavirus,” he said. “This overreaction causes me great concern over the economy.”

“I’m very concerned about sending the message that we should be shutting everything down,” he said

He ultimately voted with the rest of the supervisors to declare the emergency, noting it loosens the protocol in case an emergency contract is needed to respond to the outbreak.

City of Fresno

Fresno Mayor Lee Brand declared a state of emergency on Monday in response to the coronavirus and announced a number of measures the city is taking to serve residents during the pandemic.

The Fresno City Council voted unanimously the same day to approve the mayor’s declaration. The council supported a price-gouging ordinance after reports that some markets were selling items at exponentially high rates.

Officials have also thinned out some of the less necessary items from the City Council meeting scheduled this week. No ceremonial matters are scheduled for Thursday’s meeting, for example.

State response

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday urged all movie theaters and gyms across California to shut down temporarily, and for restaurants to close except for takeout service.

That order escalated the governor’s directive a day earlier, when he said all bars and nightclubs statewide should close and that restaurants should limit their occupancy. He said Californians older than 65 should voluntarily self-isolate at home.

The local health emergency has been executed in an effort to be proactive, allowing the County to expedite their planning and response to potential COVID-19 cases and make additional resources available to the County to limit and slow community spread of the disease.

Although the individual risk for contracting COVID-19 continues to remain low in Lake County, all community members should take the opportunity to plan for the possibility of local cases and the potential for community spread. Clearly, the virus is spreading widely—as of March 8, 2020, there were four hundred twenty-three (423) cases in the United States with nineteen (19) deaths. Outbreaks continue to spread in Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South East Asia and the Western Pacific– and the global impacts are beginning to be felt.

Lake County Public Health is prepared to manage and investigate suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. Public Health will continue to work closely with federal, state, and local partners to provide the public with accurate information about actions to be taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to care for those who may become ill with this virus. As with other respiratory infections, there are steps that everyone can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

People Can Protect Themselves By:

The best way to prevent the spread of illness, including; seasonal flu, novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and other respiratory illness is to practice everyday illness prevention steps:

Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing

If soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, making sure to rub your hands together until the sanitizer is dry

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash

Avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.

Staying home if you are sick, especially from work, school and public places.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces

Personal Preparation Measures Include:

Gradually stock up extra supplies of important items, such as: soap, hand sanitizer, tissues, over the counter medications and prescription medications.

Gradually stock up on non-perishable foods.

Create a back-up plan for work, school and childcare in the event of closures.

Talk to your workplace about getting ready. Plan for telework, if possible.

Create a space in your home to care for sick family members.

Replace handshakes with elbow-bumps – make a game of this with your kids.

What to Do if You Think You’re Sick:

Previously, all testing was being performed at the CDC laboratory in Atlanta.

Diagnostic testing for Coronavirus is becoming more available with state testing at 19 California Public Health Laboratories including in Sonoma County. Commercial labs like Quest are now offering these tests. Unfortunately, the capacity continues to be limited, so during this transition period, only the highest risk patients are recommended to receive testing. Speak with your medical provider if you have symptoms.

Call Ahead if You Have Symptoms:

If you develop a fever, cough and shortness of breath, and believe you could have COVID-19, notify your healthcare provider by phone. Call ahead so that you can be safely evaluated and prevent exposing others.

Always check with trusted sources for the latest accurate information about novel coronavirus COVID-19 by visiting the following websites:

“Things haven’t changed yet in Madera county, we still have one case, there’s no evidence of community spread so for me it’s the time to put everything in place to keep things the way they are and to keep things from going up,” said county health officer Simon Paul.

Officials say school closures have a cascading effect on other government services.

“What that does is provides us with flexibility in the county to allocate resources needed, reassign staff to different roles, as the situation changes in response to COVID-19,” said public health director Sara Bosse.

Mendocino County Makes Emergency Declaration to Prepare for Future Coronavirus (COVID-19) Activity In partnership with Mendocino County Chief Executive Officer/Office of Emergency Services Director, Carmel J. Angelo and Mendocino County Health Officer, Dr. Noemi (Mimi) Doohan, the County has declared a public health emergency in order to prepare for future Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) activity in our community. Ad While Mendocino County still has ZERO cases of COVID-19 and ZERO persons under investigation, this emergency declaration has been made proactively as surrounding counties do have recent COVID-19 activity. A declaration of emergency is a legal document that opens the door to further resources and coordination between local, state and federal agencies; helps speed up emergency planning; and, assists in emergency contracts or staffing. This declaration also allows for reimbursement by state and federal governments for local government initiatives that lessen the impact of an emergency. “The situation surrounding this novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, continues to evolve rapidly,” said Dr. Doohan. “This declaration will allow us as a County to deploy additional state and federal resources, and I am confident that this will help us be as prepared as possible to respond to COVID-19 activity.” Mendocino County has worked daily with local, state and national officials since early January to monitor and respond to COVID-19. Mendocino County Public Health is working in close coordination with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as health care providers throughout the Mendocino County. More information will be shared tomorrow through Mendocino County’s Press Conference on Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This information will be live streamed through the County’s website. Sheriff Matt Kendall and County Health Officer Noemi Doohan will be presenting, in addition to other local dignitaries.

Local schools in Merced County began preparations Monday to shut down classes for at least a month amid the growing threat of coronavirus.

Meanwhile, the Merced County Board of Supervisors on Monday formally declared an emergency. As of Monday afternoon, Merced County had no confirmed coronavirus infections. Nearby Stanislaus County, however, has reported three infections.

Merced County Office of Emergency Services and the Department of Public Health first declared a health emergency Friday. The Board of Supervisors held an emergency meeting Monday to officially ratify the plan.

“This declaration wasn’t made lightly,” Supervisor Scott Silveira said about the local public health emergency. “This cuts through the bureaucratic red tape.”

The declaration opens the county to funding, reimbursement and resources, as well as expediting emergency response processes that are typically slowed by local provisions or regulations.

County officials said it is not a matter of if the county gets a confirmed COVID-19 case, but when. They stressed that the situation is evolving rapidly. “These two emergency declarations are preemptive,” Supervisor Lloyd Pareira said. “The emergency hasn’t shown itself in Merced yet.”

County Public Health Director Rebecca Nanyonjo-Kemp said it’s possible someone in Merced County could already have the virus, but without increased laboratory testing capability, the county cannot be sure.

“We have been impacted, as the rest of this state has been, with our laboratory testing capabilities to get a true and accurate portrait of the spread of disease throughout this community,” she said.

Twenty individuals have been tested for coronavirus in Merced County. All came back negative or are still awaiting results. That number does not include commercial labs, which recently gained the ability to test for COVID-19. However, the county would be notified if any tests were positive.

County officials continued to urge people to disseminate accurate information and curb the spread of misinformation, which can cause panic. Official information and resources can be found through the county, the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.

Impact on local schools and parents

On Sunday, Merced County school district superintendents and county education officials held an emergency meeting where they decided to close classes at all 20 local school districts starting Thursday, preschool through 12th grade, with classes expected to resume Monday, April 20.

School officials said they are using Monday through Wednesday to give school districts a chance to plan for drive-thru meal services, which will launch Thursday.

Some parents aren’t waiting until the schools officially close to keep their children at home. For example, unofficial numbers from the Merced Union High School District show that excused absences Monday were up to four and half times higher than normal, according to Sam Yniguez, district spokesperson.

Yniguez said parents who choose to keep their children at home can do so without repercussions. But if it makes more sense for parents to send their child to school before Thursday, that’s OK, too.

“This is one of the reasons why we’re not closing right away,” Yniguez said. “We are giving parents and caregivers time to get their affairs in order before the upcoming school closure which starts Thursday.”

Some parents said the situation is causing added stress.

“It’s definitely a disruption to our schedules, so there is some stress too because we’re not sure how long this will last,” said Dalia Magana, 35, from Merced. The mother of three was picking up her 9-year-old child near Burbank Elementary in Merced on Monday.

Magana said that she relies on child care, but she is able to work from home.

She said local education officials made the right decision in closing the schools.

“It’s safety measures and I think that it’s the right thing to do even though we’ll all have to sacrifice. I think we all have to do our part and be OK with disruptions, be OK with stress because it’s going to keep other people safe.”

David Smythe, a junior at Merced High, also said he understood the need for closures. “But I can see how it’s kind of unfair to seniors, especially this is their last year at this school and it’s kind of being compromised by them closing the school down,” he said.

Nathan Quevedo, spokesperson for Merced County Office of Education, said MCOE received messages from parents about the school closures. Some parents had questions about childcare options and what the closure will mean for parents who work full time.

“We really hope to have more information and more resources available for our communities in the next 24 to 48 hours. I can say that we’re developing a webpage now, mcoe.org/covid19, that will link directly to these resources,” Quevedo said.

Quevedo also said there are plans to have a map on the website with information about school meal preparations, which will most likely be a grab-and-go style, in order to try and limit the social interaction between nutrition services staff and the community.

“We really have to think about there’s still people that will provide vital services in our schools and make sure that they’re safe and that we have the correct protective gear, that we’re not putting them in a dangerous situation, we’re being thoughtful about all of it,” he said.

Quevedo echoed Yniguez sentiments, saying for parents who don’t feel safe sending their children to school, attendance is optional for most districts until Thursday.

“If (children) are exhibiting flu-like symptoms or if they don’t feel good, or if you as a parent just don’t feel safe sending your child to school, we understand,” he said.",263228,NA

Monterey County on Friday declared a local emergency related to the COVID-19 coronavirus — though no cases have been detected in Monterey County.

The move was a precautionary measure taken to activate and coordinate resources, county officials said Friday.

A health event in Gonzales and the Sea Otter Classic at Laguna Seca have also been postponed because of the coronavirus.

""After careful consideration, and although we are not experiencing any active cases of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in our community, nor in Monterey County, we have decided to take the precautionary measure of postponing the Community Summit that was scheduled for this Saturday, March 7th at Gonzales High School to a future date,"" the city wrote in a letter.

Coronavirus is highly contagious respiratory virus that has infected more than 100,000 across the globe, including 260 in the United States. California has treated 70 people for the disease, according to the New York Times.

On Friday, Gonzales announced it would be pushing back the summit, which was planned to celebrate the city's selection for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Culture of Health Prize from among 200 communities that applied.

The prize honored five communities for ""pursuing innovative ideas and bringing partners together to rally around a shared vision of advancing health, opportunity, and equity,"" according to a prior press release from Gonzales.

The event was supposed to run from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Gonzales residents would also receive free T-Mobile hotspots.

The Sea Otter Classic, a four-day bicycling festival that draws tens of thousands to Laguna Seca, and the Bicycle Leadership Conference have also been postponed, the Steinbeck Rotary reported Friday. Information on a new date will be posted at www.seaotterclassic.com, possibly by the middle of next week.

They're among the latest events cancelled across the United States because of COVID-19. Austin's SXSW music, film and technology festival was cancelled Friday because of the coronavirus, which is spreading across the world.

In addition, the virus has led to two cruise ships' passengers being quarantined at sea, including the the Grand Princess anchored about 100 miles from Monterey Bay.

The U.S. Coast Guard flew test kits out to the ship Thursday. Of 46 people tested, 21 tested positive, according to USA Today.

Most infected people have mild symptoms, but its fatality rate has bounced between 2% an 3.4%.

That concerns health officials, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because it could easily spread among vulnerable populations.

At least 14 people have died across in the United States and more than 3,200 have died across the world.

Tips to protect yourself and others from coronavirus

This map shows the countries that have reported Coronavirus infections (Photo: PROVIDED/CDC)

The CDC has created a website dedicated to COVID-19.

It says the following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.*

Fever

Cough

Shortness of breath

The CDC offers these tips for preventing COVID-19:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

Impact: Salinas Chinese restaurant business dips slightly amid coronavirus outbreak

There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, according to the CDC. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.

People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately, the CDC advises.

By midday Monday, public health officials around the Bay Area had confirmed at least 258 cases of the virus, including at least four deaths. The Bay Area accounts for more than half of the confirmed cases across the state.

Seven Bay Area jurisdictions instituted a shelter-in-place order effective Tuesday through at least April 7 in an effort to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. The order applies to residents in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Marin counties and the city of Berkeley.

In Napa County, a local public health emergency was declared last week by Napa County's health officer. Although there were no confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus among Napa County residents as of Monday, leadership of all four cities have all now followed suit.



The risk of COVID-19 infection in Napa County appears to be moderate, according to public health officials.



""Health and safety of our community and employees is of utmost importance to all of us,"" Napa City Manager Steve Potter said. ""The responsibility to keep our community safe is taken very seriously by city staff.""



In an abundance of caution and in light of the state's recent direction — asking bars, brewpubs, nightclubs and wineries to close, as well as asking those over age 65 to self-quarantine — the Napa City Manager's Office is working to develop a path forward to respond to the evolving nature of COVID-19, according to a city news release.

Potter declared a local emergency to help local small businesses access funds available from the Small Business Association and other resources, and to provide greater authority to quickly respond to the changing nature of the situation.

The Napa City Council meeting Tuesday was canceled, but a special meeting was held Monday night for ratification of the city of Napa's emergency proclamation.

Likewise on Monday, St. Helena City Manager Mark Prestwich declared a local emergency while also calling for social distancing measures intended to reduce ""the exponential growth rates of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,"" according to a city news release.

Social distancing is a practice recommended by public health officials to stop or slow down the spread of contagious diseases. It requires the creation of physical space of at least 6 feet among people who may spread certain infectious diseases. Residents are strongly encouraged to practice social distancing in stores, restaurants and public spaces, and to avoid mass gatherings at this time.

St. Helena city residents 65 and older are encouraged to quarantine themselves and shelter at home.

In addition to California Gov. Gavin Newsom calling for the closure of bars, wine bars and brewpubs to help stop the spread of the virus, he also encouraged choosing take-out as a food option and asked restaurants to reduce their occupancy by half to keep people farther away from each other.



""As a city, we are working to balance continuing community services while also following guidance by health professionals to slow the spread of COVID-19,"" St. Helena City Manager Mark Prestwich said. ""Our essential services including police, fire and public works field operations will continue while City Hall and library services transition to this appointment-based approach for safety and social distancing reasons.""

In the city of Calistoga, the March 17 City Council meeting, the March 18 Mayor's Forum, the March 19 Council Goal Setting Workshop, and the March 25 Planning Commission meeting were all canceled.

All Calistoga City buildings are closed to the public with the exception of the police department lobby.



All Calistoga youth, young adult and senior recreation programs are suspended until March 31, including the Calistoga Community Pool and all aquatics programs. As previously reported, all Calistoga schools are closed through April 13. The Calistoga Boys & Girls Club is also closed.

The Calistoga Farmer's Market is closed through March 31.

The grocery store CalMart in Calistoga has instituted a phone-in and order pickup program for seniors and residents with medical conditions who are advised to home-quarantine. Deliveries are also being offered within 1 mile of the store. For information on the preorder program, call 707-942-6271.

In the city of American Canyon, all public meetings, gatherings and recreation programs have been canceled through April 12 — the lone exception being Tuesday's City Council meeting, which residents can watch on the city's YouTube Channel or its Facebook Page.

""Importantly, American Canyon remains open for business, albeit differently than before,"" City Manager Jason Holley said. ""While city facilities such as the treatment plants, Corporation Yard, Aquatic Center and Senior Center are now closed to the public, staff is still working at these locations to deliver services in new and different ways. Please continue to check for updates on our website for the latest information.""

The cities within Napa County are all in close contact with the Napa County Public Health Department, which is in contact with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the new coronavirus. Napa County is updating its coronavirus webpage with pertinent information about the coronavirus crisis.

There are no known cases of coronavirus in Nevada County currently.

“Nevada County Public Health has ramped up preparedness activities as we’ve seen COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, spread in California, and diagnosed most recently in Placer County,” said Jill Blake, Nevada County Public Health Director. “These declarations enhance Nevada County’s ability to proactively respond to local needs if or when a confirmed coronavirus case happens in Nevada County.”

The emergency declarations allow the County access to additional resources such as mutual aid, financial reimbursement and increased coordination with state and local partners. The local and health emergencies will be considered for ratification by the Board of Supervisors at their March 10th meeting next week.

“In addition to increasing our resources with emergency declarations, our Emergency Preparedness Program has been reaching out to their health care coalition partners, such as skilled nursing and residential care facilities, daily if not more frequently,” added Jill Blake. “We are making sure our community partners have the most up-to-date information on the coronavirus and are thinking about their Personal Protective Equipment resources and preparedness plans.”

Following the recent death of an elderly adult who contracted coronavirus in Placer County, Nevada County encourages the community to prepare for the possibility of local, sustained community transmission.

“We know that being elderly and having underlying health conditions greatly increases the risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19 and of dying from this illness, whereas healthy, younger populations might only experience mild flu-like symptoms,” continues Jill Blake. “Like Placer, we are encouraging our residents that are healthy and not at a higher risk to reach out to those more vulnerable and help them plan for the possibility of transmission of coronavirus in Nevada County. We are calling on all our community partners, from our in-home care facilities to those who have elderly neighbors, to help slow the spread and think through their own preparedness plans.”

The community can help slow the spread of coronavirus by:

• Washing your hands often for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water.

• Coughing into a tissue or your elbow if a tissue isn’t available.

• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth especially with unwashed hands.

• Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces. Nevada County Environmental Health has created recommendations for homes with known or suspected coronavirus infections (PDF).

• Keeping your distance from people who are sick, especially if they have a respiratory virus. If you think you are exhibiting symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) and have been exposed to the coronavirus, call your local health care provider. Contacting them in advance will make sure that people can get the care they need without putting others at risk.

Since there are no diagnosed local cases currently in Nevada County, now is a great time to prepare for an actual event. Public Health is asking the community to consider how they might adjust if daily routines are disrupted by an outbreak:

• Can you work from home/remotely?

• What are your transportation plans if public transportation is disrupted?

• If schools are closed, do you have an alternate plan for childcare?

• Do you have enough food, medications and other necessities to sustain you and your family if you needed to stay home?

The move is largely in response to a proposal to move coronavirus patients to a facility in Costa Mesa, which has sparked a bitter court battle, Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Michelle Steel and Vice Chairman Andrew Do said at a news conference. At the center of the dispute is a proposal to use the Fairview Developmental Center as a coronavirus quarantine site, an idea that drew swift and fierce condemnation from city, county, state and federal officials representing the area.

“The county of Orange continues to support Costa Mesa in opposition of state and federal government’s decision to move COVID-19 patients to the Fairview Center,” Do said.

He and other officials say the transportation of patients into Orange County does not “preserve the health of our community,” which has a population of more than 3 million.

The city of Costa Mesa requested a temporary restraining order from a federal judge on Friday that blocked possible plans to send the affected individuals to the center.

On Monday, U.S. District Judge Josephine Staton ordered federal and state officials to meet with local officials from the county and Costa Mesa to answer specific questions about how the Fairview center was chosen. According to Steel, the status of the restraining order will be decided on March 2.

“We will do whatever we can do keep Orange County coronavirus-free,” she said.

The declaration of a local emergency and a local health emergency creates a mechanism for officials to ask for mutual aid from county, state and federal partners in the event that resources are exhausted, county health officer Nichole Quick said. The declaration allows Orange County to better leverage resources for staffing and agency coordination.

“It expands our ability to respond in a nimble and flexible way in the future,” county health officer Nichole Quick said.

Quick said Orange County will start testing patients who exhibit flu-like symptoms for coronavirus.

There has not been any outbreak of the coronavirus in the county so far, although one resident has tested positive for the illness. That individual has since fully recovered, health officials said.

Wednesday’s decree follows San Francisco Mayor London Breed’s declaration of an emergency a day earlier on the heels of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s warning that COVID-19 is likely to spread within U.S. communities.

“Ultimately, we expect we will see coronavirus spread in this country,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday. “It’s not so much a question of if, but a question of when.”

“With 60 U.S. cases of coronavirus, we are facing a real-life crisis that must be managed,” Orange County Supervisor Donald P. Wagner said. “I support an emergency declaration, not because I necessarily believe the public is in more danger, but because the federal and state governments refuse to give us enough information to discharge our public health responsibilities. We want to be vigilant in ensuring the county is prepared and has sufficient resources to prevent and combat any possible outbreak of COVID-19.”

Rep. Katie Porter (D-Irvine) reiterated the declaration’s intention to prepare, not panic, the community.

“Coronavirus is a serious and growing threat, and the only way we’ll manage this public health emergency is with collaboration grounded in science,” she said.

San Diego and Santa Clara counties have already issued similar declarations.

Health officials in Orange County confirmed one of the first cases of coronavirus in the state in late January. Another patient tested positive in Los Angeles County. Both had traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

On Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters how the state is addressing coronavirus concerns.

“We’re not just preparing — we’ve been actively participating in addressing this issue for many months, aggressively,” he said. “In fact, there’s no other state in America that’s been more involved in addressing the issue.”

Newsom said he met with Trump administration officials to discuss the coronavirus when he traveled to Washington D.C. earlier this month to attend a National Governors Assn. meeting and the state continues to work closely with the federal government.

“We have had a very good relationship, open lines of communication, two-way conversations,” Newsom said. “We’re developing quite good levels of trust, and continue to work through this dynamic moment. I am proud of also being a Californian, where we’re not turning our backs on people, and that’s not the case in every state in this country.”

The governor said the state has been involved in monitoring and identifying individuals who have been repatriated to the state and other travelers returning to California independently on commercial flights.

“Everyone’s concerned,” Newsom said. “There hasn’t been a day since December that’s gone by where we haven’t demonstrably been engaged, and I think that’s an example of the resolve that we have to meet this moment head on. And so, rather than expressing concern, expressing anxiety, I want to demonstrate resolve to address that concern and anxiety, and I think that’s happening in all levels of government, both the county level, obviously at the state level and I couldn’t be more proud of our folks. But also I’ll say this, there’s no reason for me to say it, unless I believe it: at the federal level as well.”

In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti said the city is taking precautions to monitor the spread of the virus.

“The city of Los Angeles will continue to be proactive and take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and I commend our city and county response agencies for their hard work to keep us safe. My office is working closely with federal, state and county agencies to monitor the situation,” Garcetti said in a statement to The Times.

The mayor’s office said Los Angeles International Airport is also taking precautions to keep travelers and employees safe, including the use of CDC health screeners at the LAX.

There have been more than 81,000 cases of confirmed coronavirus and more than 2,700 reported deaths, most in mainland China.

The first coronavirus death in California has been confirmed in Placer County, health officials say.

According to the Placer County Public Health Department, the deceased was an elderly adult with underlying health conditions. This person was just diagnosed presumptive positive for the illness on Tuesday, according to the health department.

Original story

Placer County declared a local health emergency after health officials confirmed the second case of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the county after a patient who recently traveled on cruise ship tested presumptively positive.

According to Placer County officials, the patient is an older adult who likely was exposed to the novel coronavirus while they were traveling on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico. It was the same cruise ship that a Sonoma County COVID-19 patient was on before contracting the virus.

The patient is critically ill and is isolated from other patients at the local hospital, county officials said.

RELATED: First case of coronavirus confirmed in Placer County

Placer County Public Health Officer Aimee Sisson told ABC10 in a phone interview that healthcare workers are quarantined after being exposed to the second confirmed coronavirus patient.

""We expect to see additional cases in coming days, including cases of community spread, not linked to ravel,"" Sisson said in a press release. ""We are declaring these emergencies today so we will be able to activate and deploy resources to adequately respond to an increase in cases.""

Placer County officials confirmed the first case of the coronavirus on Monday. The patient is a NorthBay VacaValley Hospital health care worker who had previously been exposed to another coronavirus case in Solano County.

Health officials said the health care worker is currently in isolation and showing mild symptoms. All those who had close contact with the patient will be quarantined and monitored.

According to the CDC, coronavirus (COVID-19) is a family of viruses that is spreadable from person to person. Coronavirus is believed to have been first detected in a seafood market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. If someone is sick with coronavirus, the symptoms they may show include mild to severe respiratory illness, cough, and difficulty breathing.

Currently, there is no vaccine. However, the CDC suggests the following precautions, along with any other respiratory illness:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Wash your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds.

The CDC also says facemasks should only be used by people who show symptoms of the virus. If you're not sick, you do not have to wear a facemask. The CDC says the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low.

A Declaration of Local Health Emergency was signed by Plumas County’s Public Health Officer Mark Satterfield on March 16 and ratified March 17 by the Plumas County Board of Supervisors. This declaration will allow the county to access necessary resources and staffing to appropriately respond to the threat of COVID-19. It will also provide the county with the ability to access state and federal resources.

The supervisors approved two resolutions during their regularly scheduled meeting Tuesday, March 17, adding Plumas to the list of counties in California declaring a local emergency county. A four-fifths vote was required of supervisors to pass both resolutions.

Supervisors, acting on the advice of County Council Craig Settlemire, accepted the two resolution proposals under urgency items on the agenda. Settlemire agreed that the resolutions were too late to post on the regular agenda and could not wait until the April 7 meeting.

Also, under Gov. Gavin Newsom’s emergency plan temporarily amending parts of the Brown Act, supervisors Kevin Goss and Sherrie Thrall attended the meeting by conference call.

In a report to supervisors, County Administrator Gabriel Hydrick discussed ways supervisors can allow telecommunications for county employees. It will return for possible action April 7. If approved, this would allow some county employees to work from home.

As of Monday, March 16, at 5 p.m. there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19. There have been 13 tests, with six negative and seven with results pending.

The unidentified patient is undergoing testing at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage.The other known case in a county resident was diagnosed in a person who was a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship who was diagnosed last week and is recovering at a medical facility in Northern California.That person has not returned to Riverside County since leaving the cruise ship, officials said.""The public health emergency declaration will support the county's planning and response efforts and is a signal to the community that the disease has been introduced to the area,"" said Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser.The county had already activated a medical health department operations center to better coordinate public messaging and planning with agencies in the community.Kaiser's declaration will be submitted to the county Board of Supervisors for expected ratification at the board's meeting on Tuesday, March 10.Since the novel coronavirus outbreak was first recognized in Wuhan, China in December 2019, there are nearly 110,000 cases worldwide, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.

(KTXL) — Sacramento County declared a public health emergency Thursday due to the novel coronavirus.

Officials say the local emergency declaration will allow the county to receive outside mutual aid and request federal or state funding.

“Our intent in proclaiming a state of emergency in response to the spread of COVID-19 is to ensure uninterrupted access to the resources necessary to keep people as safe as possible and lessen disease transmission,” said Phil Serna, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors. “The proclamation should not be considered a reason for elevated concern; in fact, it is quite the opposite as it helps us in our mission to contain the virus.”

As of Thursday, there have been four confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county, according to Sacramento County Public Health officials. That number includes one person who is from somewhere outside of the county or state but is being treated in Sacramento County.

One person in Sacramento County has recovered from COVID-19.

UC Davis Medical Center has also reported all 89 employees who came in contact with a COVID-19 patient are doing well and will be able to return to work. Results from those who were tested came back negative, according to UC Davis Health.

Health officials say that case was the first known instance of COVID-19 community transmission in the country.

The patient, who is from Solano County, was initially hospitalized at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville. One of the hospital’s health care workers has since tested positive for the virus after coming in contact with the patient.

"43","California","San Joaquin","https://www.recordnet.com/news/20200317/san-joaquin-county-declares-emergency-over-coronavirus","San Joaquin County declares emergency over coronavirus","Number of confirmed cases of coronavirus now at 13.

STOCKTON San Joaquin County declared a local emergency Tuesday morning related to COVID-19, the new coronavirus, which has infected 13 county residents to date. It’s a step beyond the local health emergency previously declared that will allow the county to provide additional support to Public Health Services and other agencies seeking assistance.

""It does potentially provide additional sources of funding for expenses that have been incurred,"" said Office of Emergency Services Director Marcia Cunningham, explaining that it puts the mechanism in place to account financially for the costs the agencies experience as a result of dealing with the virus.

That in turn will allow the county to seek reimbursements through state and federal channels.

Cunningham declared the local emergency at 9:41 a.m. Tuesday during a special meeting of the county Board of Supervisors. The board has seven days to ratify the declaration, which they are expected to do at their regularly scheduled meeting next week.

Cunningham told supervisors that five of the county’s seven cities Lathrop, Lodi, Manteca, Stockton and Tracy had previously declared local emergencies in their jurisdictions.

The county has implemented the Multi Agency Coordination group, also known as MAC, to bring all the cities and the county together Wednesday ""to discuss a common approach"" to the current crisis.

Above all, Cunningham said, ""We all need to remain calm."" She also emphasized the importance of each individual taking care of themselves, washing hands, keeping areas clean and avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people.

During Tuesday’s special meeting, the board conducted business with no members of the public in the audience. While they weren’t banned from the chamber, the public was ""strongly encouraged"" to stay away and watch the meeting live online.

About a dozen public comments came in by email during the meeting that were read aloud by the board clerk and responded to by supervisors and county officials.

Complying with what is becoming the new normal, seating behind the dais was arranged to allow supervisors, the board clerk and the county administrator to sit 6 feet apart. County Counsel Mark Myles, who usually sits behind the dais, sat alone at the staff table in front of the supervisors.

In the single vote the board took on Tuesday, they unanimously ratified interim Health Officer Dr. Maggie Park’s earlier declaration of a local health emergency throughout the county.

Park told supervisors what is known about the 13 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county: there have been no deaths as a result of the virus; all the patients are adults (no children have tested positive); three are travel-related; two are from household contact, also referred to as person-to-person spread; and two are community spread. She did not know the source of the other six cases.

County Public Health has moved from a containment strategy tracking all possible exposures to the virus and quarantining people to a mitigation strategy.

""Due to the increased volume of cases, and the fact that we now know we have community spread, we have moved into the mitigation phase which is basically telling people if you have flu-like symptoms to stay home and self-isolate,"" Park said.

""Once you have community transmission, we longer actually issue those quarantine orders because we have other work to do as far as continuing surveillance and messaging and providing guidance. So it is all self-monitoring at this point,"" she said.

Concern about the county’s inventory of critical supplies needed to deal with the virus was addressed by Emergency Medical Services Director Dan Burch, who said that a cache of personal protective equipment (protective gowns, face shields) and respirators have been dispersed to ""community partners"" including hospitals and pre-hospital agencies including fire departments and ambulance companies.

""We were able to immediately offer that assistance to those entities so they could ramp up their own supply chain issues. We are continuing to process those requests to assist but now we have to send those requests to the state and access the state cache,"" Burch said, noting it is a slower process.

Large health care providers such as Kaiser Permanente, Dignity Health (St. Joseph’s Medical Center) and American Medical Response (AMR ambulance) have their own supply chains that are still working, according to Burch

The EMS agency has also planned for and stocked up on hospital beds that can be deployed to the county’s seven acute-care hospitals based upon a study of available ""surge space"" at each hospital, such as conference rooms and hallways, should the need arise.

Supervisors were also told that the Office of Emergency Services has activated its Joint Information Center, bringing together public information officers and representatives from 32 agencies countywide in order to provide consistent messaging to the public.

The primary sources of information recommended were two county websites: SJReady.org and SJCPHS.org. Information and assistance is also available by calling 2-1-1 or (209) 468-3411. Residents who believe they have symptoms of COVID-19 — fever, cough or difficulty breathing — should call their health care provider first.

With the new order issued by the county health officer restricting hospital visitation, supervisors called upon San Joaquin General Hospital CEO David Culberson to discuss activities at the county-run public hospital in French Camp.

Culberson explained that more telemedicine consultations are being conducting each day in an effort to limit face-to-face contacts between providers and patients.

""We are substantially ramping back visits. It was up to half as many on Monday,"" he said.

And while there have been some staff exposures to patients with the virus he did not say how many half tested negative and the other half are still pending test results.

Since last week, Culberson has met every afternoon with the hospital’s infection control practitioner, medical staff leadership, ancillary support and nursing teams to analyze current patients or those who have come through that have been tested or may need to be tested.

Training has been implemented as more is learned about the virus. Every morning, Culberson said, a current inventory of supplies such as face masks and gowns is conducted in light of some shortages over the past few weeks, but what has helped is that San Joaquin County is a Northern California distribution hub for many critical medical supplies.

And while the hospital has upgraded its ventilators, required by patients with critical symptoms, it has retained its older ventilators that can be used as demand increases.

""On Monday, we established a drive-thru clinic. It is by appointment only. We have to have a virtual visit on a telephone first with a provider before we can make an appointment. We saw 25 patients (Monday) and I’m told demand is pretty high today,"" Culberson said.

He made it clear that the hospital drive-thru clinic operating between 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is not for asymptomatic patients. They first must consult with a doctor before being referred for testing.

Park discussed the county’s current testing capacity, noting the Public Health lab is only able to process 60 tests per day. That is changing however, as more private clinical laboratories are coming on line to process the tests for the coronavirus.

"44","California","Santa Barbara","https://www.noozhawk.com/article/santa_barbara_county_declares_public_health_emergency_for_coronavirus","Santa Barbara County Declares Public Health Emergency for Coronavirus","Santa Barbara County officials declared a public health emergency Thursday evening as they continued to monitor for signs that the deadly novel coronavirus had made its way to the area.

Thus far, no cases of coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, have been found locally, according to Van Do-Reynoso, the county’s public health director, who spoke at a press briefing at the County Administration Building in Santa Barbara.

Six people have been tested and cleared — five on the South Coast and one in the North County — and nine others currently are in home quarantine and are being monitored by Public Health personnel, said Paige Batson, the county's deputy director for community health.

In addition to declaring a public health emergency, the county has issued a health officer order calling for all gatherings of 250 people or more to be postponed or canceled.

Beyond that, officials are calling for “social distancing” in most other settings — including directing people to stay at least six feet apart in smaller gatherings.

That order will be in effect until March 30, when it will be reviewed.

Meanwhile, the county has set up a public information line for the coronavirus: 833-688-5551.

It will be open until 10 p.m. Thursday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday, and probably over the weekend.

As of Thursday evening, Public Health personnel have monitored 61 people, Batson said.

""All have been cleared,"" Batson said.

Seventeen labs in California are conducting coronavirus testing, including in San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties, according to Batson.

""While testing has been expanded,"" Batson said, ""it's important for everyone to know there is still certain criteria that needs to be met for persons to be tested, because we have to prioritize those that are at greater risks of having adverse outcomes.""

COVID-19 testing is ""not necessarily going to be offered or provided upon request,"" Batson said.

Second District county Supervisor Gregg Hart said local government ""is doing everything we can to prepare for and respond to the coronavirus...This is the time we must all act in the best interest of our community and work together to contain this virus.""

The guidelines to be implemented are in alignment with the California Department of Public Health’s most recent guidelines issued Thursday regarding social distancing and public gatherings.

""Even though we have zero cases in Santa Barbara County,"" Do-Reynoso said, ""we are taking these two actions because of the declaration recently by the World Health Organization that COVID-19 is a pandemic, and also because of the recent California Department of Public Health issuance of recommendations on social distancing.

""The health officer order provides firm perimeters for canceling or postponing group gatherings that are nonessential, professional, social and community gatherings. Mandating social distancing is timely, and a proven strategy in prior pandemics.""

Dr. Henning Ansorg, the county's public health officer, said, ""It's ""essential that we implement social distancing as it's the most effective way to slow the spread of disease.

""To protect public health and slow the rate of transmission of the coronavirus in our area, we are implementing measures that are proven to be very effective during previous epidemics and pandemics, and delaying the rate of infection and reducing illness and death.""

Gatherings of people ""who are at the highest risk of severe illness"" of COVID-19 ""need to be limited to no more than 10 people,"" Ansorg said.

Jan Koegler, manager of the county Public Health Department’s emergency preparedness program, said Public Health personnel are communicating with local skilled-nursing facilities and assisted-living providers.

""These are facilities that serve some of our most vulnerable residents,"" Koegler said. ""Many of them have already implemented restrictions on visitors and restrictions on activities for their residents to prevent the spread of disease.""

Public Health personnel also are working with senior service providers and the Area Agency On Aging to coordinate information to keep seniors living independently safe, as well as ensure senior meals continue ""even though some of the senior activity centers will limit their activities now due to the need to provide social distancing,"" Koegler said.

She added that county environmental health service staff are working on procedures and guidance for restaurants ""so they can continue to operate given the instructions for groups and for staying six feet distance from each other.""

County officials hope to have details on Friday, Koegler said.

The county also issued a local proclamation of emergency, said Kelly Hubbard, director of the Office of Emergency Management.

""The local proclamation gives us the opportunity to coordinate with our community partners and the Public Health Department, and utilize our resources available,"" Hubbard said.

Also Thursday night, in a hastily called meeting, the Solvang City Council unanimously adopted measures related to the public health concern, adopting the county public health order, authorizing staff to pull the Solvang Century bike ride permit for routes through the city, and directing staff to work with local businesses to mitigate the economic impact.

The city’s motion also authorized the mayor to send a letter to state and federal representatives seeking financial assistance.

Council members had expressed concerns about the impact on its small businesses and city funding, which heavily relies on tourist spending.

“The fact that all these go into effect until March 30 to me is extremely optimistic, and I sure hope this is the case because this could be huge,” Councilman Robert Clarke said.

Sheriff Eric Magrini said he had been reluctant to declare a local emergency because he did not want to elevate the level of fear. But the declaration will help local officials qualify for state and federal funding to help prevent the spread of the virus, he said.

""It's been something where I've not been wanting to cry wolf,"" Magrini said.

There was one case in the county where a man in his 50s tested positive earlier this month, but the man is no longer showing symptoms and he has since tested negative for the virus, he said.

""However, considering the severity of the outbreak in other parts of California and the United States, we are taking this step to maximize our ongoing response efforts to this serious and evolving situation,"" county Health Officer Karen Ramstrom said.

Buy Photo Shasta County Health Officer Karen Ramstrom declared local emergency due to the novel coronavirus threat on Tuesday, March 17, 2020. However, there are no active cases in the county. (Photo: Damon Arthur/Record Searchlight)

""The local health emergency will allow for an efficient and swift response by waiving administrative barrriers and regulations and allowing us to access state and federal resources to support this response,"" she said.

The announcement was made during a brief news conference where Ramstrom and Magrini were joined by other officials from the county and the cities of Redding, Anderson and Shasta Lake.

The Redding City Council is expected to make a similar announcement for the city during a meeting Tuesday night.

Ramstrom said the last time a local emergency was declared was during the 2018 Carr Fire, which burned 229,651 acres in Shasta and Trinity counties, destroyed 1,614 buildings and killed eight people.

Declaring a local emergency won't mean law enforcement will be enforcing a ban on large gatherings or sending deputies out to make sure bars are closed, Magrini sai.

""We live in a responsible community, and I don't foresee taking that kind of enforcement action,"" he said. ""This isn't any kind of martial law.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Trump have already declared emergencies for California and the nation, respectively. Newsom has called for canceling or postponing any gatherings of more than 250 people.

On Sunday, Newsom took the unprecedented step of calling for all bars, wineries, nightclubs and brewpubs to close statewide.

He also urged seniors and people with chronic health conditions to isolate themselves at home in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

The state also will reduce occupancy in restaurants by half to keep people farther away from each other, Newsom said.

“We require social distancing in these establishments,"" the governor said, using the phrase that's become part of everyday conversation about keeping away from other people to prevent the spread of the illness.

In the North State, many entertainment venues, including the Redding Civic Center and Cascade Theatre, have postponed numerous shows and events. One of Redding's largest annual events, Kool April Nites, has also been called off.

Most school districts in the county have canceled classes until after spring break next month. Movie theaters in Redding have also closed their doors.

Magrini said that in the current climate, he had been reluctant to declare the local emergency because he did not want to elevate the level of fear in the community.

But he said declaring a local emergency would enable county officials to qualify for state and federal assistance.

The illness caused by the virus has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CDC

Sierra College on Monday declared a state of emergency and is limiting who can access its campuses, according to officials.

Hours later the University of California at Berkeley announced it would be suspending most in-person classes, starting Tuesday.

Sierra College officials are limiting access to the system’s s four campuses for the month of March.. Only registered students, faculty, staff and affiliates are authorized on the campuses, according to the college’s website.

“This declaration also allows us to take actions outlined by the California Department of Public Health and distributed by the California Community College Chancellor’s Office to provide instruction remotely and support continuity of instruction,” read the statement.

Instruction will continue for the college’s 20,000 students. But by Wednesday, faculty should be prepared to provide instruction remotely, including labs and other activities. The college district will determine which labs will remain on site.

By March 18, all campuses are expected to be online under a campus learning system called Canvas.

Instructional field trips, travel for classes, all community events held on campus and student club events are canceled for March.

All athletic competitions are still scheduled but without spectators. Travel and away games are continuing for now, according to the district’s statement.

The four-campus college serves students at locations in Rocklin, Roseville, Grass Valley and Truckee.

The college district stated it took action after two Sierra College employees were exposed to the coronavirus. Both employees returned to work at the Rocklin campus administrative office after they were exposed, and were sent home once they were notified of the exposure. No one associated with Sierra College has tested positive for the virus, according to officials

Los Rios Community College District, which operates Cosumnes River College, American River, Folsom Lake and Sacramento City, has not yet made a decision similar to Sierra College. Los Rios officials are in the process of planning multiple scenarios including converting all classes to online.

The patient did not travel to China, or have contact with anyone who did.

""At this point we don't know where the patient was exposed,"" said Dr. Bela Matyas, Public Health Officer for Solano County, speaking at a news briefing Thursday afternoon.

The unidentified woman is hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.

She was transferred there from Northbay VacaValley Hospital when her conditioned worsened.

At both facilities, she came into contact with medical staff, and potentially infected numerous people.

""We have identified exposure to dozens of employees on our health team but it still remains less than one hundred,"" said Steve Huddleston of Northbay Healthcare.

Those employees, along with the woman's family and colleagues, are now in home quarantine or even more stringent isolation conditions, and are checked on several times daily.

""We make sure their needs are met, and they aren't developing signs or symptoms of the disease so there is an ongoing active surveillance of that group of people,"" said Matyas.

Officials won't disclose where in Solano County the woman lives, but say she has no connection to Travis Air Force Base or the Americans evacuated from China and quarantined there.

A federal whistleblower has claimed government workers sent to assist at airbases were not well equipped, trained or protected, and traveled freely off-base.

Solano officials defend the protocols at Travis.

""I have never worked with a more meticulous group of people, they were scary meticulous,"" said Matyas.

What is needed- all agreed- is a wider criteria for who should be tested, but there are obstacles.

Early symptoms resemble a common cold or respiratory infection, and test kits have not made it into mass production.

""We're still dealing with a test that is limited in availability so we have to prioritize by risk and we're not going to prioritize maybe's over likely's,"" said Matyas.

Medical professionals, including those at U.C. Davis Medical, have been frustrated that the test is not performed readily, as they requested with the female patient.

CDC defended the delay.

""There were multiple people involved over four days to make that decision, it wasn't necessarily CDC,"" said Dr. Christoper Braden of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

By declaring a local State of Emergency, Solano County hopes to prevent outbreak in high risk settings where people have close contact. Already, local schools are disinfecting shared surfaces, in anticipation of continued Coronavirus spread.

""We picked up on it, and it may also be in other communities and they don't know it,"" said Braden, ""but we're going to see community transmission in the United States.""

Their best hope, officials say, is to buy time to develop a vaccine and improve treatment.

""We know the cat is out of the bag in terms of having it spread so what we're trying to do is slow the spread as much as possible,"" said Matyas.

Shifting from trying to contain the disease, into managing it, is a different mindset for the public as well.

""From thinking that we're keeping it somewhere else, we've got to prepare to protect ourselves when it's here,"" said Braden.

Local health officials urge practicing good hygiene to reduce the risk of becoming infected with a respiratory virus, such as the flu or coronavirus. This includes:

Amid fears about a widening presence of novel coronavirus in Sonoma County, the Board of Supervisors finalized a local public health emergency Wednesday as health officials step up efforts to locate 78 local residents who may have been exposed to the disease during a San Francisco-based cruise to Mexico.

Those Sonoma County residents were among 2,600 passengers on the Grand Princess ship that returned to San Francisco Feb. 21 after a 10-day cruise. Twenty-five shared a shuttle trip from San Francisco back to Sonoma County Airport.

The move comes as the county ratchets up emergency preparations to control the spread of a virus that still is not entirely understood.

The county currently has two confirmed cases of the virus, known as COVID-19. Both patients are hospitalized in isolation, though county officials have declined to say where.

But “we now believe that there a number of other people in our community that have been exposed, and so we’re trying to identify who those folks are,” Sonoma County Health Officer Celeste Philip told supervisors during an emergency meeting Wednesday.

Partial activation of the county emergency operations center already has begun, and the county is establishing a 211 hotline intended to help residents find answers to pressing questions, Emergency Management Director Christopher Godley told supervisors.

But the county already is at a disadvantage in its efforts to gain control of the virus, in that it is still awaiting the delivery of test kits from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and so is limited in the capacity and speed with which it can attempt to detect the virus, Philip said.

She said she hoped the county receives some test kits later this week, which would reduce lag time between a patient’s expression of symptoms and confirmation of the virus. But for the moment, specimens from patients showing signs of infection have to be sent to a state lab in Richmond or a CDC lab in Atlanta for testing, she said.

That makes it critical for residents to focus on practices “that we know prevent spread of disease,” such as social distancing, hand washing and telecommuting, Philip said.

She and Godley said local medical and emergency officials had been monitoring the growth of coronavirus since long before the first cases began appearing in the United States, largely through the transfer of patients from a Diamond Princess cruise that had been quarantined in Japan until late February, when American passengers were returned to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County and Travis Air Force Base in Solano County.

One of the patients from Travis Air Force Base who tested positive for the virus but never developed symptoms was transferred Feb. 24 to a hospital in Sonoma County, where the person remains asymptomatic, according to Rohish Lal, public information analyst with the Sonoma County Department of Health Services.

A second patient believed to have contracted the virus on a Grand Princess cruise ship voyage from San Francisco to Mexico Feb. 11-21 fell ill later and also is hospitalized in Sonoma County, health officials said. That person is in stable condition, Lal said Wednesday.

They are among at least 53 confirmed cases in California, where the first confirmed fatality included another Grand Princess passenger from Placer County, who died at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Roseville on Wednesday, officials said.",495025,2020-03-07
"49","California","Sutter","https://yubanet.com/regional/bi-county-health-officer-recommends-state-of-emergency-for-covid-19-preparedness-in-yuba-and-sutter-counties/","Bi-County Health Officer Recommends State of Emergency for COVID-19 Preparedness in Yuba and Sutter counties","March 10, 2020 – While there remain no confirmed cases of COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) in Yuba-Sutter at this time, Bi-County Health Officer Dr. Phuong Luu today recommended both county Board of Supervisors declare a state of emergency – a step already taken by 15 other California counties that is necessary to gain access to resources that will help bolster ongoing efforts to respond to the public health threat. The Yuba County Board of Supervisors and Sutter County Board of Supervisors will consider her recommendation at their respective meetings on Tuesday, March 10, 2020.

Dr. Luu and staff from Yuba and Sutter counties believe this is the right time to make the declaration to ensure an appropriate, timely and organized response in the event COVID-19 cases are identified in the bi-county region. Dr. Luu believes it is simply a matter of time before someone in the region tests positive for the virus, so increasing monitoring and responsive capabilities now will further enable public health teams to prevent as much community transmission as possible.

Staff from both Yuba and Sutter counties have been working closely together to monitor residents who believe they could have COVID-19, communicate plans with area hospitals and health clinics, ensure nurses and first responders have the tools necessary to keep themselves healthy and safe, and communicate important information to the public. A coronavirus preparedness group was established last month, and that group has been in communication with each facet of the community – like schools, hospitals, Beale Air Force Base, and public safety entities – to ensure the area as a whole is equipped with the best knowledge and tools to minimize the impact of COVID-19.

Over the past several weeks of COVID-19 concerns, public health staff from both counties have been operating what is known as a Department Operations Center (DOC) at a low level. The DOC is now elevating to the next level and stepping up efforts to address the health threat. A bi-county Emergency Operations Center based in Yuba County has also opened. This means staff from both counties are working together around the clock to ensure that resources and staffing remain in healthy and reliable supply.

A Bi-County Call Center has been established to respond to inquiries from area residents regarding the COVID-19 threat. The Call Center number is 749-7700, and will be open 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The Call Center is intended to field general questions, not provide medical advice. Please call your primary care physician for medical advice.

Yuba and Sutter counties have been planning for this possibility and staff are properly prepared to handle the work to come. Since there are NO confirmed cases in either county, the approach may look different from Sacramento, Placer, and other counties, where community transmission has been confirmed. Nonetheless, increasing the level of public health response is necessary in focusing vital resources on preventing severe illnesses and deaths.

With no confirmed cases at this time, and per California Department of Public Health guidelines, en masse cancellation of schools is not recommended. Schools will continue with measures to prevent spread of COVID-19. The Counties continue to work closely with the Offices of Education in both counties and their respective school districts to plan and prepare our schools for COVID-19 (those CDPH guidelines can be read here).

Dr. Luu continues to recommend hand-washing and practicing good hygiene. Vulnerable populations – the elderly and those with chronic illnesses – are encouraged to stay home as much as possible and avoid large gatherings. Keeping yourself from getting sick in the first place remains key in this effort.

If you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness such as fever, chills, or cough and have recently traveled to a country with widespread community transmission (Iran, Italy, China, South Korea), or been in close contact with a patient who has had COVID-19, immediately contact your medical provider by phone – do not go into Urgent Care, the Emergency Room or the doctor’s office. Instead, you should call your personal physician, who can assess whether your illness matches those of COVID-19 and if testing should be completed. If testing is indicated, the physician will then contact Dr. Luu, Bi-County Health Officer for consultation.

Tulare County and Visalia both declared states of emergency late last week in response to the COVID-19 virus. Fresno County and Fresno also declared a state of emergency this week.

Last night, Visalia council members ratified the city's local emergency proclamation.

""This is done mostly to take advantage of available resources, to be able to access funding, reimbursement, etc.,"" City Manager Randy Groom said.

Groom declared the local emergency Saturday in his role as director of emergency services, giving city council seven days to ratify the decision and triggering the opening of a city emergency operations center.

The Tulare County Board of Supervisors ratified two county declarations at Tuesday's board meeting, one of a local emergency and one of a local health emergency, both declared on March 11.

“We declared a local emergency to get local funding if we needed additional staffing or reimbursements for testing supplies,” Tulare County Supervisor Amy Shuklian said.

On March 4, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency in response to COVID-19. Tulare County joins at least 24 other counties in California in proclaiming a local emergency because of the virus. Fresno County supervisors also declared a local emergency Tuesday.

Tulare

Tulare City Council will also discuss COVID-19 and its local impacts at Tuesday's council meeting. Tulare has not yet declared a state of emergency. Mayor Jose Sigala told the Advance-Register he plans to request a special meeting to do so.

“We can’t wait until April 7 to have another city meeting,” he said. “This is a big issue for our city. It’s happening and we want to do everything we can to protect our employees and the public.”

The public is invited to attend Tuesday night's 7 p.m. meeting in person, but staff will have social distancing precautions in place. After city staff presents an update, council members are expected to give staff direction.

""We are all hands on deck,"" Sigala said.

Groom said that while Newsom has established recommendations to close bars, taprooms and other establishments, Visalia and its police do not have the authority to enforce those recommendations as law.

""The Council has not taken any actions to close any particular kinds of business,"" he said. ""The Chief of Police (Jason Salazar) has clarified that his department cannot enforce a recommendation or guideline.""

Sonora, CA — In the wake of federal, state and regional actions, Tuolumne County has now enacted emergency measures due to the coronavirus outbreak.

According to Health Department spokesperson Michelle Jachetta, Interim Health Officer Eric Sergienko initiated the declaration Friday afternoon. It includes an order to cancel, postpone or modify large gatherings as per state guidelines. The Tuolumne County Supervisors are expected to ratify the action at a meeting next week. Pertinent information is as follows:

The Public Health Department has activated its Department Operations Center (DOC) to effectively respond to the COVID-19 incident, including communication and coordination with the County’s federal, state, and local partners.

While there are not yet any confirmed cases within the county, the Acting Tuolumne County Health Officer has declared a local health emergency in order to enhance the effectiveness of the response to COVID-19, to seek and utilize mutual aid, potentially obtain reimbursement, and ensure that the County’s public health professionals and providers have all necessary resources to provide quality care and keep our community safe. Along with this declaration, Dr. Sergienko has issued an order to support the guidance on mass gatherings released by the State this week.

Testing

Testing is being conducted at the discretion of health care providers in the community, based on their clinical assessment and currently recommended guidance. Tests that will be conducted through the Public Health laboratory system are coordinated with the County Public Health Department. Testing is available through Quest laboratories with a health care provider’s order. These tests are not required to be communicated through the Public Health Department, but local providers are strongly encouraged to do so. Any positive test result must be reported to the Public Health Department

Mass Gatherings

Guidance from the State was issued on March 11th regarding mass gatherings in an effort to slow the rate of transmission of COVID-19 in California. You can review the guidance details here. Dr. Sergienko has issued an order to support and implement these state recommendations in Tuolumne County.

Schools

At this time it is not being recommended to close schools as Tuolumne county does not currently have any confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no evidence of community spread. It is of more benefit to allow students to continue to attend school with the implementation of the recommended increase in hygiene and monitoring practices, as well as suggested limitation of some activities. Recommended actions for schools can be found here. Please do not send your children to school if they are ill and/or have a fever without taking medication.

What You Can Do

The CDC has updated information and guidance for specific audiences such as businesses, healthcare professionals, schools, community- and faith-based organizations, vulnerable populations, and more here. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) also has specific guidance documents available here.

Practice everyday preventions to stay healthy. Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, or with hand sanitizer when soap is not available. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. If you are ill, stay at home. If other family members are ill, including children, keep them home.

Practice social distancing: put more space between yourself and others. About six feet is good, if possible. Avoid contact with people who are sick.

Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects often with soap and water or household cleaners. Don’t forget your cell phone.

If you have symptoms or get sick…

Stay home, unless you need to seek medical care. Call ahead before visiting your doctor, clinic, or hospital. Wear a face mask to avoid spreading germs.

Cover your cough with a tissue and immediately throw it in the trash, or cough into your bent elbow. Wash your hands after using a tissue. Wash your hands often and avoid sharing personal items.",53874,NA

Please consider a digital subscription to The Star so we can continue doing this important work.

A local health emergency was declared in Ventura County as public health officials reported the county's third travel-related COVID-19 case less than 24 hours after announcing the second case.

The third case, reported by officials on Thursday, involved a county resident returning after journeying to Egypt, said Ashley Bautista, Ventura County public information officer. It still has to be confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The county is also awaiting CDC confirmation in a case announced Wednesday involving a person returning from travel in Italy.

The emergency declaration by Ventura County Public Health Officer Robert Levin labels the spread of virus as an imminent threat. Officials said the decision was triggered by the rise in local cases, the nationwide spread of the novel coronavirus and Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement that scheduled events statewide expected to attract more than 250 people should be canceled or postponed.

Coronavirus: Here's what we know about cancellations, closures in Ventura Count

""The declaration will enhance our ability to take further lifesaving actions as we continue to respond to this evolving health and safety threat,"" said Ventura County Executive Officer Mike Powers. ""These actions will allow us to have even greater coordination to protect our residents and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. We will continue to mobilize county resources, coordinate with agencies and partners and raise awareness about how everyone can take action to be prepared.""

The declaration could also bring state and federal funding to aid with the county's response, said Bautista.

Public health leaders asked businesses, schools and other groups to begin implementing social-distancing plans that involve online classes, work-at-home arrangements and other strategies to limit interaction that can spread viruses.

""That doesn't mean these places have to close down,"" Bautista said, adding the goal is to come up with ways to limit exposure.

All three reported COVID-19 cases in the county involve people exposed during travel — not person-to-person spread in the general community.

Limited information was released on the county's third case. It involved a returning traveler who spent little time out in the community, meaning the risk of exposure is considered low, said Bautista.

The case announced Wednesday night involved a county resident who flew into Los Angeles International Airport after traveling to Italy. The traveler sought medical attention at an undisclosed location in Los Angeles County before returning home to Ventura County, said Bautista.

FYI: Here's what we know about higher-risk groups, coronavirus in Ventura County

Testing for the coronavirus was initiated by a health-care provider at an undisclosed site in Los Angeles County. The person is believed to have not had contact with people in Ventura County.

The county's first case, confirmed by the CDC on Tuesday, involved a passenger who was on a Grand Princess cruise in February.

Two more COVID-19 test results were still pending as of Thursday. At least 95 people had been tested in Ventura County.

Newsom's announcement not only calls for gatherings to be canceled but says smaller events should be arranged so people are separated from each other by at least 6 feet.

Levin's local health emergency declaration is set to be considered for ratification by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. Several cities also declared a state of emergency on Thursday and Friday, including Camarillo, Thousand Oaks, Fillmore, Simi Valley, Moorpark and Oxnard. City councils are scheduled to consider ratifying the declarations.

""The news can sound scary and rightfully so,"" said Thousand Oaks Mayor Al Adam of the coronavirus. ""However, I encourage everyone to proceed with a calm focus and keep compassion for each other at heart.""

The patient is an older woman with underlying health conditions, according to a news release from Yolo County. She is hospitalized and improving.

“Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world, I am not surprised that the virus is in our county”, Yolo County Public Health Officer, Dr. Ron Chapman in a written statement, said.

Yolo County also announced it will issue a local health emergency, along with a local emergency related to coronavirus. The proclamations will allow the county to receive funding and other resources to control the spread of coronavirus.

”This is obviously a challenging situation which makes it all the more important to remain calm, practice the public health guidelines and rely only on factual information from trusted medical sources,” Yolo County Board of Supervisors Chair Gary Sand said in a statement.

According to the CDC, coronavirus (COVID-19) is a family of viruses that is spreadable from person to person. Coronavirus is believed to have been first detected in a seafood market in Wuhan, China in December 2019. If someone is sick with coronavirus, the symptoms they may show include mild to severe respiratory illness, cough, and difficulty breathing.

Currently, there is no vaccine, however, the CDC suggests the following precautions, along with any other respiratory illness:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Wash your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds.

The CDC also says facemasks should only be used by people who show symptoms of the virus. If you’re not sick, you do not have to wear a facemask. The CDC says the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low.

"54","Colorado","Alamosa","https://alamosanews.com/article/alamosa-county-declares-state-of-emergency","Alamosa County declares state of emergency","ALAMOSA — A state of emergency was declared Wednesday by the Alamosa Board of County Commissioners at a special meeting here after hearing presentations from different specialists within the county.

The board also approved a public health order limiting gatherings to 30 people or less. It is important to mention that the order does not include restaurants, homeless shelter or religious services, as long as these entities adhere to the requirements for social distancing. Currently restaurants are closed for all but take-out, per State Order.Also, the order also does not include schools. In the future, it may be determined that school closures are necessary. Schools, parents and employers should take steps now to prepare for the possibility of prolonged mandatory closures.

While being in a state of emergency sounds menacing, it will likely not affect most citizens on a day-to-day basis. The two main things it does are, it makes Alamosa County Public Health and Environment (ACDPHE), incident command and imbues the ACDPHE with the ability to issue orders and guidance to protect public health. And it charges Alamosa’s Sheriff with keeping order and enforcing ACDPHE orders.

Beyond that, the remainder of the declaration is focused on the County Administrator and Emergency Manager working to ensure a strong line of communication and an effective response for the public. All things that will be very helpful helping Alamosa get to May safely.

At the meeting on Wednesday, Public Information Officer Linda Smith presented first discussing the importance of public information during this trying time.

“We have been pushing out public information and doing everything that we can to support what the public health agencies are doing,” said Smith. She also discussed a federal government based program that could in the future provide personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks and gloves to the valley. However, Smith was sure to make it clear that that was just a possibility and was in no way concrete.

“That’s still very much in the air because we don’t know what that’s going to look like,” Smith went on to reaffirm the importance of information, stating that her office’s focus was shifting away from testing results and more towards paying the current situation the proper respect, adhering to advice coming from proper avenues meaning the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and other reputable sources.

Fellow presenter Lilian Coll, Alamosa’s regional epidemiologist, also touched on the hot button issue of test results in Alamosa, confirming that as of press time that there have been five tests from Alamosa that have been sent out and of those one has come back negative. Smith pushed that despite the San Luis Valley still being free of positive cases, that the populace needs to remain vigilant in their hygiene and health practices because COVID-19 is likely present in the valley.

Though not on the agenda, Dr. Bill Brinton MD, internist-general, was in attendance and weighed in on some similar issues, first lamenting the sheer volume of information that is bombarding the public currently before discussing preparedness.

“I do think Alamosa county and the counties of the valley have an advantage,” said Brinton, “Because we had established plans in place both for bioterrorism starting in 2001 and pandemic influenza starting in 2005, and the planning was well in place by the time the pandemic came in about 2008. We also exercised our plans for the Alamosa Salmonella outbreak around that same time.”

Brinton presented an opportunity to the medical professionals of the valley stating that since we have yet to be infected that we could use this time to look to other counties similar to ours and come up with an effective response. He closed his comments on the current situation by addressing a need for PPE among healthcare workers and ill persons.

Smith addressed the PPE supply chain issues and spoke on a prioritization matrix for that, which the state seems to be doing at the that level as well, which would suggest a possible relief in the future.

Also presenting to the board was Emergency Manager Eric Treinen. Treinen discussed the transition from an operations center to a Unified Command Group (UCG). He suggested that the UGC would offer more resources, personnel and would allow the county staff to focus on local issues.

Among the changes, Treinen addressed the addition of a second Public Information Officer to help work alongside Linda Smith who has been working tirelessly to keep the public abreast of any changes on Coronavirus.

“I’ve been sharing a lot of information with Gigi (Dennis) and the board to how best help our county and what is the best we can do for our county,” Treinen said.

THAT, the Alamosa County Board of County Commissioners confirms,

determines, and declares that the likelihood of the number of COVID-19 cases

occurring within the State of Colorado and spreading to Alamosa County is high,

and that such likelihood constitutes a local disaster emergency which warrants an

emergency response and furnishing aid and assistance to affected portions of the

community.

THAT, the Board recognizes that Alamosa County Public Health and

Environment (“ACDPHE”), by and through its director and in coordination with

the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, which is leading

the statewide response to COVID-19, is currently incident command for the

response to COVID-19 within Alamosa County. ACDPHE has authority under

state law to issue orders and guidance, and take other actions as necessary

to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board directs county staff

to take such actions to effectuate the orders and guidance of ACDPHE as

THAT, this Resolution and Declaration is necessary for the public health, safety

and welfare of the citizens of the County of Alamosa, State of Colorado.

Public Health Order

Pursuant to Section 25-1- 506 (2)(a)(I), Colorado Revised Statutes, this Order is effective

within the entirety of Alamosa County, including all towns within the county, until April

22, 2020.

On March 10, 2020, the Governor of Colorado declared a state of emergency related to

the presence of COVID-19 in the State. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has confirmed that COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the State of

Colorado.

On March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency

due to COVID-19.

On March 15, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance to

cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States for 8 weeks.

On March 16, 2020, the President of the United States issued a statement including

recommendations to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people.

The age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the population in Alamosa

County places it at risk of serious health complications, including death, from COVID-19.

Although most individuals who contract COVID-19 do not become seriously ill, persons

with mild symptoms and asymptomatic persons with COVID-19 may place other

PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT

vulnerable members of the public at significant risk. A large surge in the number of

persons with serious infections can compromise the ability of the healthcare system to

deliver necessary healthcare to the public.

The limitations on large gatherings and the use of social distancing decrease the risk of

COVID-19 transmission to our most vulnerable populations, and is especially

important for people who are over 60 years old and those with chronic health

conditions due to their higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. This Order

Eagle's municipal election is still scheduled for April 7. Eagle voters will elect a town board, determine the fate of the town's home rule proposal, and decide whether revenue from a tobacco tax will stay with the town or go to Eagle County's government coffers.

EAGLE — Eagle’s town manager declared a local emergency and canceled all non-essential, non-government meetings and events and has closed public access to town-owned facilities on a rolling basis to limit exposure and slow the transmission of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus.

Eagle Town Manager Brandy Reitter took the measures Monday to protect the Eagle community and town workforce.

She declared a local emergency that allows greater flexibility in deploying town employees and acquiring needed equipment, supplies and other resources.

“Please be assured that the town is taking what we feel are cautious and prudent steps in partnership with Eagle County and the State of Colorado,” Eagle Mayor Anne McKibbin said. “Our priority is the health of our community members, maintaining essential town services, and taking steps to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 or novel coronavirus. We ask for your patience, and cooperation, in this effort.”

Operational changes and closing town facilities should limit person-to-person spread of the virus. These changes include but may not be limited to:

Consolidation of in-person business transaction activity at Town Hall

Shifting non-essential services to telephone-only

Reduction of hours for various departments

Reitter’s emergency declaration orders non-essential, non-public safety municipal workers, whose duties allow, to begin making arrangements with supervisors to temporarily work remotely from home through April 1, 2020. The goal of these arrangements is to continue to provide as many town services as possible while minimizing in-person contact.

Commission Chair Debbie Bell said citizens will be notified via the county’s website, Facebook pages and notices placed on all entrances how to accomplish their county business using the telephone, websites or designated drop boxes.

According to the resolution declaring a local disaster emergency, the potential outbreak of COVID-19 in Fremont County constitutes a local disaster particularly because of the high number of elderly residents and incarcerated persons combined with the confirmed presence of COVID-19 in a number of Colorado counties, including those adjacent to and in close proximity of Fremont County.

The resolution states that the “Fremont County Department of Public Health and Environment anticipates that, due to the contagiousness of the illness and the fact that numerous travelers from around the world visit the county, Fremont County will see cases of the virus and its transmission within the community.”

Developing social distancing policies prior to an extensive outbreak has been a proven means of helping to contain COVID-19 outbreaks, the resolution states.

FCDPHE anticipates that without appropriately responding to the illness, including postponing and canceling large public events, numbers of cases within Fremont County will rise, may result in serious illness or death for certain members of the community, and also will have the effect of interrupting the functioning of the community in terms of work and school attendance.

The Fremont County community is strongly directed to engage in social distancing and to postpone or cancel any gatherings or events where people will congregate in large numbers and/or in close contact with one another, the resolution states.

County employees will continue to report for work and be assigned tasks based on their position by their supervisors; however, these tasks could involve assisting with sanitizing of the office spaces, Bell said. Employees who are systematic consistent with COVID-19 (fever, respiratory, etc.) are to notify their supervisor immediately.

Employees who are placed in isolation/quarantine by a medical professional or the Department of Public Health are to follow the orders of such. County employees pay status will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Boys & Girls Club of Fremont County is closing its doors for the next two weeks

“While it is not mandated that we close at this time, we feel that it is the prudent thing to do,” said Darcy Cole, CEO. “We will re-evaluate on Friday, March 27. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause the families that we serve. We are reaching out to our community partners to help in any way that we are able.”

The county Public Health Department has also set up several hotlines for members of the public and the business community seeking guidance on how they can help in limiting the spread of the pandemic and volunteer to assist those who will be adversely affected.

For those with symptoms, or general questions about the disease, how to self-quarantine, or questions about symptoms, call the bilingual Aspen to Parachute COVID-19 hotline: 970-429-6186. Operators speak Spanish and English and can transfer callers to medical professionals for advice about dealing with personal symptoms and those seeking testing. However, tests for the coronavirus are being reserved for the most severe cases, according to public health officials. This hotline can also transfer callers to mental health professionals. The hotline hours are from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week.

For businesses, faith-based organizations, schools and other organizations seeking information on how to clean, manage events, or other issues related to the outbreak, the county has set up a hotline at 970-945-1377, extension 8120, or email publichealthinfo@garfield-county.com. This hotline is also available to Spanish speakers.

For people seeking opportunities to help others in their community, Garfield County has set up a clearinghouse to connect volunteers to those in need at 970-945-1377, extension 2020. Spanish speakers may also call this hotline, but a response may be delayed.

In light of the first two confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Garfield County March 14, the board of county commissioners declared a local disaster emergency Monday.

The declaration is a necessary step to activate funding for response and recovery efforts. The “cost and magnitude of responding to and recovering from the impact of the ensuing event is far in excess of the county’s available resources,” the order states.

The declaration of the emergency is valid for seven days, but can be renewed while the disaster lasts.

As the number of known cases of the new coronavirus in Larimer County increased, county officials formalized their declaration of an emergency pertaining to the spread of the virus.

The declaration, which was ratified by the county commissioners Tuesday, opens access to state and federal resources, including funding and caches of medical supplies.

Tom Gonzales, director of public health for Larimer County, told the commissioners during their Tuesday morning meeting that the county had three positive cases of the coronavirus and “we only expect that number to increase.” A fourth case was identified late Tuesday afternoon.

On Tuesday, the county health department confirmed a second known case linked to a Loveland long-term care facility. A worker and resident — a woman in her 90s — at the North Shore Health & Rehab Facility have tested positive for coronavirus.

The worker lives in Weld County, and that case was announced Monday, while the case involving the resident was announced Tuesday.

Larimer County's first case, a Johnstown resident who is also a health care worker, was announced March 9.

The third case is a Fort Collins man in his 40s. The fourth case is a woman in her 50s who lives in Fort Collins. Both are quarantined in their homes.

Woodward Inc. confirmed a worker at its Drake Road facility tested positive for the virus. The facility has been shut down for a thorough cleaning, Woodward spokeswoman Julie James said. It was expected to be closed for a ""few days.""

The manufacturing company is not releasing any information about the worker, including which shift the person worked or the person's hometown, James said.

Woodward shut the plant down on Tuesday and sent workers home. All workers will be paid for time lost due to the closure. More details are expected to be released by Woodward later.

Coronavirus in Colorado: Tracking the confirmed cases, latest news and updates

To stem the spread of the virus, Gonzales said he will prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people, as recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He previously prohibited gatherings of 250 people or more.

The county also will enforce the state's 30-day closure of bars, restaurants, theaters, gyms, breweries, and other gathering places.

Restaurants: As restaurants face 30-day closure, food delivery sites brace for impact

As of Tuesday, there were at least 183 positive COVID-19 cases in the state. Two people have died following infection.

On Tuesday, the Weld County Department of Public Health and Environment announced a man in that county died from coronavirus.

He was in his 70s. It marks the second death related to coronavirus in Colorado.

Gonzales is also looking into changing how Larimer County tracks potential cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, because the state is so backlogged on testing. The state can process 250 tests a day; it has about 1,500 tests backlogged, Gonzales said.

For example, people who display symptoms of the disease and are considered high-risk — as in older than 60 or with underlying health conditions — would undergo a “panel” of tests to check for influenza and other viruses. Then, if a person comes up negative for flu and other diseases, they will be considered positive for COVID-19. That person then would be isolated.

“We are trying to look at things creatively because of the backlog on tests,” he said.

The commissioners allocated $500,000 in reserve funds to pay for staff time and supplies used in responding to the crisis. Last week, the county spent about $50,000 on staff time and $10,000 on supplies.

Emergency Manager Roger Doll said it would be prudent to declare a state of emergency during the Morgan County Board of County Commissioners special meeting Thursday morning.

“It would allow us to enact policies and procedures to protect the citizens of Morgan County, as well as the employees,” Doll said.

The declaration permits access to emergency funds, federal and state assistance, and allows the county to adjust policies, procedures and ordinances to ensure the public welfare. The commissioners thought a state of emergency was appropriate, not just to address potential community spread of COVID-19, but any subsequent effects.

Most county buildings are closed, but services are still available. The only building that will remain open to the public is the Morgan County Department of Human Services. It will remain open but take preventative measures inside the building and offices.

Many of the services at the county DHS building are to be primarily handled online, by phone and through the mail.

The Department of Human Services is working on how to adjust many of their programs. They are cutting all non-essential home visits, and people looking for assistance benefits are encouraged to use the online portal at Colorado.gov/peak.

The services at the Morgan County Administration Building for motor vehicle services, recording services and election services are available both online and through the mail.

Vehicle registration renewals can be done online at mydmv.colorado.gov, by phone at 970-542-3521, through the mail at P.O. Box 1399, Fort Morgan or drop your registration documents and payment at the drop box by the Administration Building in Fort Morgan.

Recording services similarly can be put into the county’s drop box or done online and people are encouraged to call the office for guidance.

Voter registration can be updated at govotecolorado.gov. If the Internet isn’t available, people can call in to the clerk’s office and request registration forms be sent to them.

The sheriff’s office has suspended all inmate visitations at the Morgan County Jail, and it is giving inmates two free 15-minute phone calls a week to compensate. Besides the distancing, the sheriff’s office are continuing with their normal operations.

“We are proceeding with normal business, taking necessary precautions for our staff and our inmate welfare,” Sheriff Dave Martin said.

The Planning and Zoning Department is working on using online forms to aid them in issuing building permits both online and by phone.

Other departments, like the Public Works Department, Finance Department, and the Information Systems Department don’t have much public contact, but they are making sure their workplace habits are hygienic.

The Information Systems Department is working to keep up to date information on the website while many of their services migrate online. The websites will also host public meetings held by the commissioners while the buildings are closed.

The resolution to close all buildings passed with 2-1 vote, with Commissioner Jon Becker abstaining.

“I think self-policing is always the best bet,” Commissioner Becker said. “As we’re dealing with a pandemic, I don’t take that lightly, but I also don’t take lightly the livelihoods of people sitting out there and their ability to know what they can or cannot do.”

The other two commissioners disagreed, saying that despite the physical closure of the office all services were still available, and that it wouldn’t cause further panic.

“The county is open. We have limited access, and you’re capable of still completing your business with Morgan County,” Commissioner Jim Zwetzig said.",28404,2020-03-22

GREELEY — Weld County declared an epidemic within its borders as the number of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus increased, but didn’t outright prevent restaurants from seating diners.

In a notice Monday afternoon, Weld County public health director Mark Wallace ordered residents to practice social distancing, or staying at least six feet away from one another, and ordered all public events with 10 or more people to cancel. Events at schools, day-care centers, community recreation centers and libraries are also canceled.

The order is in effect until April 8. State health officials have confirmed five cases of the COVID-19 virus in Weld County as of Sunday afternoon.

Businesses were exempted from the order, but the department is urging restaurants to limit seating or become take-out only. That position is lighter than Denver’s all-out ban on dining in at restaurants for the next eight weeks.

Health department spokesman Eric Aakko told BizWest the county commissioners and authorities didn’t want to stop restaurants from seating customers if they can accommodate fewer than than 10 customers and provide the six feet of space.

He said the public is being asked to follow the orders on the honor system.

“If there is a large gathering we would be concerned and we would probably send a letter or something to that effect,” he said. “In events like this, it tends to be self-enforcing. People don’t want to be spreading disease unnecessarily.”

Aakko said the department can extend the order as it deems necessary.

PANAMA CITY — The Bay County Commission declared a state of emergency for the coronavirus on Tuesday despite there being no confirmed cases in the county.

RELATED: CLOSURES BAY AREA- Events, services, schools, canceled due to coronavirus concerns

County officials wanted to assure residents that the decision was for administrative purposes. The commission needs the declaration to seek Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reimbursement if there is an outbreak.

""An example I’ve used is if we had to send hundreds of employees home to work and we had to purchase laptops for those individuals, we can get reimbursed for those expenses,"" said Philip Griffitts, chairman of the commission. ""This is just kind of a protocol and paperwork trail we have to create early on.""

Mark Bowen, chief of Bay County emergency services, said the COVID-19 pandemic is reminiscent of the Ebola crisis that broke out several years ago. They were able to get equipment during that time and they haven’t had to use it yet, but they are prepared if they need to.

According to Bowen, the Emergency Operations Center has expended some funds for COVID-19, but nothing significant right now.

""It has been supplies and things of that nature and making sure the equipment we have is functional,"" Bowen said.

The main thing Bowen wants to stress to the public is if people are showing symptoms to call and not just show up to the emergency room.

""We got screening in place and 9-1-1 will ask travel questions, so that we think if somebody could have been exposed we can make sure EMS respond and police and fire stay outside,"" Bowen said. ""We want to limit the amount of healthcare workers that comes into contact with somebody that may have the virus.""

Griffitts explained that the county has been in a state of emergency since October of 2018 for Hurricane Michael and a lot of people don’t know that and the COVID-19 pandemic is no different. He also wants the public to not panic and keep doing what organizations like the Center of Disease Control (CDC) are telling the public to do.

While Griffitts doesn’t think they’ll have to send government officials home to work, they are prepared for it.

""We have folks that work for us who might have compromised immune systems, so we’re just working through those questions,"" Griffitts said. ""This is definitely a fluid situation and we’re just trying to figure it out as we go.""",174987,2020-03-19

The emergency declaration also gives Brevard County access to Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursements for coronavirus response efforts that might otherwise not be available.

There now are 70 reported cases of coronavirus infections in Florida, with four associated deaths. One of those deaths was a Floridian outside of the state at the time.

School closures, event cancellations and strong warnings to limit social contact all have been part of the major response locally to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in order to limit the number of people infected and the potential strain on the health care system.

The Brevard state of emergency declaration will allow for more streamlined government processes, should the virus severely impact the county.

Some of the advantages of having an emergency declaration are that it:

• Helps obtain necessary supplies quickly: Procurement policy may be waived to allow for timely access to personal protective equipment for first responders and sanitation supplies for critical public buildings, such as courthouses, the Brevard County Jail and the Brevard County Emergency Operations Center.

• Removes obstacles to a timely response: The county manager may be permitted to adjust leave policies and, if necessary, suspend union contracts in order to deal with a potential emergency.

• Provides timely access to financial resources by cutting red tape: Financial reserves may be accessed, as needed, to stage in anticipation of and, if necessary, respond to an emergency.

• In the event of a biological threat, reduces the threat of person-to-person transmission: Mass gatherings may be limited, as necessary and appropriate.

• Streamlines intergovernmental crisis management: Measures to better coordinate consequence management, in conjunction with Florida Department of Health and Brevard Public Schools, may be implemented.

• Better enables the county to seek federal reimbursement: The declaration of an emergency situates the county such that it may qualify for Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursement that might otherwise not be available.

Walker said the Policy Group met for about 35 minutes Saturday, and unanimously approved the emergency declaration. The panel includes the county manager, the county attorney, the County Commission chair, the county public safety director, the county emergency management director, the sheriff, the school superintendent and a representative of Brevard's municipalities.

Walker said neighboring Seminole and Volusia counties previously approved similar declarations.

Walker said the county is encouraging residents to follow proper hand-washing practices, to not go to work if they are sick, to practice ""social distancing"" and to consider steering clear of large gatherings.

""We're stressing prevention,"" Walker said.

But he added that county officials do not believe people need to stay cooped up in their homes if they are not sick, or to hoard large quantities of supplies such as water or toilet paper.

This was the first meeting of the Policy Group related to coronavirus.

But Walker said a separate task force of county officials has been discussing the issue regularly, planning county government response to coronavirus.

""We've been working on this pretty steadily in the last week or more,"" Walker said.

Walker said the county also continues to coordinate daily with the Florida Department of Health on the latest information regarding coronavirus.

Brevard residents can call 2-1-1 for up-to-date information between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.

For calls after hours, contact the Florida Department of Health COVID-19 call center at 866-779-6121. The call center is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

State health officials are urging anyone who recently traveled through Port Everglades to isolate themselves for 14 days if they start experiencing symptoms

Broward County declared a state of emergency after a fourth case of coronavirus was confirmed in the county, officials said Tuesday.

County Administrator Bertha Henry announced the emergency declaration at Tuesday morning's Broward commission meeting, saying it will make way for more resources to fight the spread of COVID-19.

State of Emergency declaration passes in @BrowardCounty for more resources as the county responds to a 4th case of #coronavirus. Watch @nbc6 pic.twitter.com/YdVQG7t7Lw — Arlene (@ArleneNBC6) March 10, 2020

The county's emergency operations center was activated to Level 2, meaning all lead emergency support teams would be notified but the emergency operation center would not be physically staffed, for now.

""They are aware they are doing it, they indicated to me whatever we need to the extent they have the ability to get it and expedite,"" Henry said.

The county has also formed a business team to address issues related to operations comprised of Port Everglades, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau, and other high-impact business areas.

The move comes after three employees of a company that greets cruise ship passengers at Port Everglades tested positive for the new coronavirus, state health officials said. The company, Metro Cruise Services, said the employees provided embarkation services at various cruise terminals in Port Everglades.

The Florida Department of Health is urging anyone who recently traveled through Port Everglades to isolate themselves for 14 days if they start experiencing symptoms.

Officials confirmed the company connection in a news release that also said a 69-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 is the fourth Broward County resident, and third employee of Metro Cruise Services, to have the virus.

""We were unaware that any of our part-time employees were sick until we were notified by the authorities,” Metro Cruise Services President Anthony Newman said in a statement. ""We then immediately notified all of our Port Everglades employees that one of their associates had tested positive and advised them that, if they have any symptoms, they should seek medical assistance and not report to work.""

The health department advisory asks anyone who passed through the port in Fort Lauderdale to isolate themselves and contact their county health department or health care provider if they start experiencing symptoms of the virus, which includes a cough, fever and shortness of breath.

NBC 6 Investigator Tony Pipitone reports on the coronavirus' impact on the cruise industry.

That conforms with new guidelines issued Monday by the CDC, which advises recent cruise passengers to monitor their health for 14 days, immediately self-isolate if they experience symptoms, and contact medical professionals for treatment.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, but it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia in older adults and people with existing health problems. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus within weeks.

Swift-moving developments over the new coronavirus ricocheted across Florida’s Capitol as Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency Monday and lawmakers disrupted their legislative session so crews in surgical gowns could swab down the House chambers. DeSantis said his declaration would enable Florida to better marshal resources and get outside help as it confronts the growing public health crisis.

Florida Department of Health

""That allows us to create a unified command structure, it also allows, if need be, out-of-state medical personnel to operate in Florida,"" DeSantis said at a news conference Monday evening. ""It allows us to more swiftly purchase any necessary supplies including masks and materials and equipment necessary to set up field hospitals. It allows pharmacists to dispense up to 30-day emergency prescription refill of maintenance medication.""

Health officials are trying to connect with all employees of Metro Cruise Services who may have come into contact with the three infected co-workers. The agency announced earlier that three Broward County men, ages 65, 67 and 75, had tested positive; the news release didn't specify which of these men are the other two company employees.

Two cruise ships that left from Fort Lauderdale — the Regal Princess and the Caribbean Princess — were later issued “no sail"" orders by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after crew members who had possibly been exposed on a California ship were tested.

The Regal Princess eventually docked at the port late Sunday and passengers were able to leave the ship. The Caribbean Princess stopped briefly in Grand Cayman on Monday to pick up test kits for two crew members. The ship is sailing off Florida's coast until it gets the all clear.

Also, late Monday, state health officials reported that a 60-year-old Volusia County woman tested positive, bringing the state's total to 20. Of those, two people have died. Fourteen of the 20 cases were diagnosed in Florida and five in another state, officials said. In addition, a California resident, now under self-isolation in Florida, has tested positive.

Collier County commissioners declared a state of emergency Monday as the novel coronavirus continues to spread, joining a growing list of local governments in Florida.

County commissioners held an emergency special meeting at the commission chambers to discuss responses to COVID-19 and receive an update from county officials about the current situation in Collier.

A local state of emergency gives county officials the emergency powers to shut down facilities such as libraries or beaches if it becomes necessary, said County Attorney Jeffrey Klatzkow.

""This gives us the emergency powers to do whatever we need to do for public health and safety,"" he said. ""And it's going to be consistent with what the feds and the state guidance is going to be.""

Among other things, Collier will shut down league play, for things like Little League, at county facilities; cancel, postpone or limit county programs with more than 50 participants; and scrap non-essential meetings, such as advisory committee, planning commission or neighborhood informational meetings.

""I'd rather be wrong on the side of being a little overly restrictive than being wrong on the side of not being restrictive enough,"" Commission Chairman Burt Saunders said.

Commissioners, spreading out on the dais to practice much-publicized social distancing, also gave the county manager the authority to order closures of high risk public facilities, such as gymnasiums and fitness centers.

County Manager Leo Ochs said after the meeting that such a determination would be made on a ""case-by-case basis,"" assessing their level of potential risk.

At fitness centers, for instance, it can be difficult to keep the equipment sanitized at all times, Ochs said.

""This will be very limited, but I just wanted the authority in the event that I thought it was necessary,"" he said, adding that there is no list currently or any specific location that the county is looking to close.

As of Monday afternoon, Collier had six people who tested positive for the virus. The county had its first confirmed cases March 10.

The Collier cases include a 73-year-old man, a 68-year-old woman, a 64-year-old woman, a 76-year-old man, a 28-year-old man and a woman whose age was not released.

Stephanie Vick, administrator of the Florida Department of Health in Collier County, told commissioners during a presentation that the county still doesn't qualify and classify as ""widespread community transmission.""

""Which is a good thing, but it can give you a false sense of security, because we're only testing those that meet the criteria at the highest risk,"" she said.

Vick said testing supplies are running low. Collier's health department ""scrounged"" and went to the health department in Pinellas County, which helped Collier with 25 tests, she said.

Other supplies are becoming scarce too, including face shields, Vick said.

""We have very little left,"" she said, adding that those have been requested from the state.

Miami, Miami-Dade County and Key West, among others, have already declared local states of emergency due to COVID-19.

Here is how to do it and how it can help curb the COVID-19 pandemic. USA TODAY

To provide our community with important public safety information, the Pensacola News Journal is making stories related to the coronavirus free to read. To support important local journalism like this, please consider becoming a digital subscriber.

Escambia County declared a local state of emergency Monday afternoon as both the county and city of Pensacola cancel all publicly permitted events with more than 50 people in response to the coronavirus.

The declaration came shortly before the Department of Health announced Escambia County had its first positive coronavirus case. Neighboring Santa Rosa County had its first last week.

On top of permitted events, Pensacola also canceled all facility reservations and rentals with more than 50 people.

Officials will reassess the situation in eight weeks following the guidelines issued from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The county also activated its Emergency Operations Center on Monday afternoon.

""We are proactively activating the EOC and declaring a local state of emergency to ensure we have the appropriate resources for this unprecedented event, "" Escambia County Emergency Manager Eric Gilmore said in a county press release. ""We encourage the public to follow CDC guidance for social distancing and proper health and hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Escambia County.""

On top of events that have already been canceled, the city's planned Census 2020 Kick-Off Event on Wednesday and AARP tax-aide services at the Pensacola Library, Molino Branch Library and Southwest Branch Library have been canceled.

City parks will remain open, but all programs are being suspended, with the exception of the city's spring break programs for school-aged children and senior citizen meal program done in partnership with the Council on Aging of West Florida. City community centers will be closed to the public.

The county's community centers remain open at this point, but the county will likely be closing them soon, county spokeswoman Laura Coale said Monday.

The city is working with the Council on Aging to transition the senior meal program to some type of take-out or home delivery system.

Later in the day, the CDC issued another revision to its guidelines and called for communities to limit gatherings of people to 10 or less.

Escambia County Administrator Janice Gilley told the News Journal she would have to speak with commissioners to decide how the county would respond.

""This is a very fluid incident,"" Gilley said. ""And so I think it would be very difficult to make any definitive statements at this moment, because as you saw today, we went from 50 before 8 a.m., to the president speaking about 10 in a gathering at 2:30 pm. So, I don't want to make a definitive statement about that yet until we can have a chance to see what the impact is in Escambia County.""

Robinson said at this time, he would not be ordering any restaurants or other businesses to close, but said that could change, especially if the Pensacola area sees community spread of the coronavirus.

""Community spread is important,"" Robinson said. ""Obviously, if we get to that point, it'll change what we end up doing. But at this point, we do not see community spread. So, the things we're implementing in the way we go about, day to day, in Escambia County, at this point is because of that. If things change, we will change, and we will probably institute new policies.""

In addition to the Escambia County case announced Monday afternoon, the Florida Department of Health announced four new cases of the virus in the state, bringing the total number of cases in Florida to 159. So far, four people have died in Florida due to the coronavirus, including a man in Santa Rosa .

Until Monday, it was difficult to get a coronavirus test in the area, with local doctors advising patients with symptoms to stay home and self-quarantine as a test was not available.

The first drive-thru testing clinic was opened Monday and the Ascension Sacred Heart call center received 211 calls by 10:30 a.m. Monday and directed 51 people to get the test in just 90 minutes after pre-screening their symptoms.

During his morning press conference, Robinson said he believes there are probably people in the community who have the virus and are not showing symptoms, but defended his position of not taking further action until there was community spread of the virus.

""We haven't gotten to that stage at this particular time,"" Robinson said. ""Again, other communities, both within the United States and the state of Florida are already there. We are not there. That doesn't say we won't get there. But we are positioning ourselves with certain thresholds. When we hit those thresholds, we will institute new policies.""

Although there were no cases yet confirmed, Robinson said small businesses, especially restaurant owners, should begin planning for the worst.

""If we reach a certain impact, I would tell restaurants to begin to think how they can either provide food for delivery or take-out in the event that something does happen with community spread,"" Robinson said. ""Again, anything can change, and we will change with the circumstances.""

Robinson said he would be drafting a letter to the state and the federal government requesting a financial assistance program for workers who miss out on work because of closures related to the coronavirus.

""Even though there'll be this period of slowdown, we want them to be able to keep their job as best they can,"" Robinson said.

""The key is social distancing."" — JONATHAN LORD, Flagler County Emergency Management director

County Emergency Management Director Jonathan Lord told the commission that President Donald Trump had recently advised people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. The number of people that authorities are saying constitutes too many has changed rapidly — an example of how quickly recommended responses to the virus have shifted.

""Something I’ve told you is probably wrong by now because things are changing so quickly,"" Lord said toward the end of his presentation.

""This time last week, the guidance was mass gatherings of more than a 1,000 should not occur,"" Lord said. ""This weekend it became 250, as of the president on the news an hour ago, it is down to 10. ... He really wants people to stay home. He’s saying avoid bars, food courts, restaurants.""

And that doesn't just go for people who feel sick: People can contract COVID-19 and remain asymptomatic — showing no symptoms — all the while passing the disease to others. So it helps slow the disease's transmission if even people who feel healthy avoid unnecessary gatherings.

Also over the weekend, Florida Department of Health-Flagler County Administrator Bob Snyder told the commission, the number of known cases in Florida jumped from 42 to 137; as of the evening of March 16, it was 142.

But, Snyder said, ""I feel like this weekend was pivotal,"" because in the county and local cities, he said, ""actions have been taken to cancel small or large gatherings.""

""That’s what mitigation is all about,"" Snyder said. ""If that continues, I think we have a high, high chance ... that we’ll be successful in watching this virus die. ... We’ve got to keep that up, and encourage that in addition to everyday good hygiene.""

Still, he said, ""At some point in time, we will have our first confirmed case of COVID-19. When? Don’t know.""

But the state will soon — likely by the end of the week — have the capacity to test as many as 625,000 people, he said, with assistance from LabCorps, Quest, various other private testing labs and AdventHealth's lab in Orlando.

""We know what to do. ... Once we do start to see cases in Flagler, we’ll be on it."" — BOB SNYDER, Florida Department of Health-Flagler administrator

That will likely mean an uptick in known positive cases.

Once there's a positive case in Flagler County, the health department will take the lead: Its nurses will interview the patient to determine who they've been in contact with over the 14-day period in which they may have contracted or been shedding the virus, and will then contact those people to see if they're sick and who they've been in contact with.

That process is called ""contact tracing,"" and the health department is accustomed to using it for other illnesses, such as HIV.

""I want our community to know, we know what to do,"" Snyder said. ""We are used to doing this. ... Once we do start to see cases in Flagler, we’ll be on it.""

Lord and Snyder have will also hold a phone meeting with assisted living facilities and nursing homes later this week, Lord said, as seniors are at heightened risk from the disease. The facilities have already started reducing visits, Snyder said.

The county is also shutting down nonessential services, such as the county library, while working to provide help to people who had relied on county services that are being reduced or shut down — for instance, the county's adult daycare program, or meals provided at the Wickline Center (which are now being delivered to individuals' homes). The virus could still be circulating as late as July or August, Lord said, citing the president's televised speech.

Although residents should be prepared, Lord said, it's unhelpful to hoard supplies.

""People should be prepared and stocking up, but the whole hoarding three years' of toilet paper, whatever motivates people to do that, this is not the time to do that,"" he said.

For people who become sick with COVID-19 and have to self-isolate, Lord said, ""We can fill in that gap to get people toiletries and meals if they’re locked in.""",99956,2020-03-18

BROOKSVILLE — With the confirmation of Hernando County’s first four coronavirus cases on Thursday, the Hernando County Administrative Policy Group enacted a local state of emergency.

""This declaration provides Hernando County Government the authority to take action as needed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of our community,'' according to a news release. ""This includes making emergency purchases, obtaining additional resources, renting equipment, hiring workers, utilizing volunteers, etc. The local state of emergency will be in effect for seven days, or until rescinded.''

Ron DeSantis' declaration of a State of Emergency in response to the coronavirus, the Hillsborough County Emergency Policy Group declared a state of local emergency in response to coronavirus.

Under the executive order, County Administrator Mike Merrill has the authority to carry out all emergency responsibilities delegated by the EPG, including taking whatever prudent action is necessary to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the community.

Highlights of the executive order include:

The Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County remains the lead advisory agency for this event.

The county administrator is authorized to convene all major health organizations in Hillsborough County to develop and coordinate, in conjunction with the Department of Health, the management of testing related to COVID-19.

All state and local business licensees, vendors, merchants and any other person operating a retail business in Hillsborough County is prohibited from charging more than the normal average retail price for any goods, materials or services sold.

The state of local emergency is in effect for seven days. The EPG's next meeting is scheduled March 19 at 1:30 p.m.





The Hillsborough County Emergency Policy Group is composed of three county commissioners, the mayors from the cities of Plant City, Tampa and Temple Terrace, the sheriff and chairman of the school board.

Hillsborough County partially activated its Emergency Operations Center on Tuesday. A limited activation of the EOC allows the county and partner agencies to better monitor actions related to the virus and coordinate resources and operations.

Lee County commissioners adopted a state of local emergency Tuesday, while simultaneously announcing the closing of many busy county facilities to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

The message from government and public safety officials is for people to conform with instructions for social distancing, working from home if possible and avoiding locations that are typically crowded.

Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Lee County stood at 5 as of noon Tuesday although two people died while at Gulf Coast early this month.

The local state of emergency was imposed mainly to make sure the county is eligible for federal disaster funds available due to President Trump's declaration of a state of national emergency.

“We are starting to incur costs as are many counties,” County Manager Roger Desjarlais told county commissioners at a Tuesday morning meeting. “The federal declaration of emergency makes available reimbursement funds; in order to be eligible for those funds we have to declare a state of emergency.”

An early cost from the crisis started to build with the opening of the county Emergency Operations Center on Ortiz Boulevard in Fort Myers on Friday. Some 70 people from county governments and outside agencies.

Most county activities that have been closed are places where individuals can gather in relatively close company. Most outdoor venues will remain open.

The county will conform with an executive order that bars and nightclubs be closed as of 5 p.m. Tuesday and limits restaurants to 50 percent of capacity, with six-foot separation on tables and capacity limited to half of the restaurant's normal capacity.

Sheriff Carmine Marceno told reporters at a news conference that the definitions of bar and restaurant are based on the percentage of total sales that are in food and other factors .

Lee County libraries closed at the end of the business day on Tuesday. They will remain closed for 30 days.

Toll collections on county bridges will be completely automated. County Manager Roger Desjarlais told county commissioners that the toll collections would be automatic, Drivers Leeway or SunPass transponders will have the tolls deducted form their accounts. Plate readers will read license tags and send a bill for the toll. The administrative fee normally charged will be waived.

Lee County parks and beaches will remain open, the county is urging people not to congregate in groups of 10 or more on the beaches.

County dog parks will closed as will animal services clinics Only a skeleton crew will be working the shelters to clean and feed the animals.

LeeTran buses continue to operate; bus drivers have been equipped with hand sanitizers and wipes to keep germs such as the coronavirus at bay.

Commission Chair Brian Hamman said reports on the LeeTran routes reveals that ridership has been down since people were urged to stay home if possible

County hearing examiner proceedings have been canceled for the next 30 days, so any scheduled hearing on proposed construction projects will be rescheduled. County permitting offices will remain open.

The county human services agency will close its lobby and serve clients online or by telephone, and county utilities will take payments only at its drive-up window and at drop boxes at the utilities offices and the city public works department.

Closures: Here's what is closed or has changed amid COVID-19 concerns

The county's law enforcement agency is also taking steps to limit spread of the virus.

Lee County jails have made plans for quarantine if it becomes necessary to isolate inmates who may have been close to the coronavirus.

Marceno said non-essential inmate movement within the jails have been reduced or stopped. Large internal staff meetings at the sheriff's office have been suspended and internal special training has been halted.

Transportation of inmates has been reduced.

Court appearances have been reduced and will be conducted with court video technology as much as possible. Video visits with inmates will be conducted only from remote locations, Marceno said.

The emergency declaration gives the county manager the authority to take a wide range of actions immediately if necessary, but county officials say it will be used sparingly.

“That’s not something we do in a vacuum or take it lightly,” said Desjarlais. “Any action we do take, we will let you know as soon as possible.”

Garbage collection will continue and public transit will continue to operate. The county's Passport transportation service for people with disabilities or facing medically critical issues will also continue.

In the city of Fort Myers, where a state of emergency took effect automatically on the county's declaration there have been cancellations, facility closures and service modifications affecting city programs and services, effective Wednesday.

All city public meetings are suspended. City parks will remain open, although programs have been suspended. The lobby of the utility billing center will be closed until further notice.

By the end of the week tents will go up at all ER locations, according to Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and CEO of Lee Health.

“We have temporarily suspended our volunteer program to mitigate risk of community spread,” he said.

Lee Health’s wellness centers are being closed and health-related classes are being cancelled.

Some Lee Health employees have expressed concerns that Lee Health has not chosen to restrict all visitors similar to the NCH Healthcare System except at end of life circumstances, according to emails.

“We have a very strict visitation policy and are screening everybody at our entrances,” Briggs said. “We are screening for travel, symptoms and potential exposure.”

“Although we do not have community spread at this time, we want to take the preemptive steps to keep it that way,” Gimenez said in a statement on his website.” “Therefore, I have decided to suspend the operation of the Miami-Dade County Youth Fair, the Miami Open tennis tournament, the MIA 5K run, and all major events at the American Airlines Arena.”

SHALIMAR — Social distancing is the only tool that local government officials have to blunt the impact of the coronavirus, Karen Chapman, director of the Okaloosa County Department of Health, told the County Commission Tuesday.

""If we don’t blunt it, we will overwhelm our medical system, and people are going to die,"" Chapman said while speaking to the board via a speaker phone.

Later in the meeting, the commission unanimously agreed to declare a local state of emergency to help protect residents and visitors from the coronavirus.

Earlier Tuesday, the state DOH confirmed a second case of COVID-19 in Okaloosa County. Like the first case, the second confirmed case is a woman in the age range of 61 to 78 and is travel-related.

RELATED: TRACK THE CORONAVIRUS: Interactive map from FDOH with updates and places

Declaring the local state of emergency will allow the commission to act with ""a little more nimbleness"" to help protect people in Okaloosa County, county Public Safety Director Patrick Maddox told the board.

The commission took several state-of-emergency-like steps Tuesday before approving the actual declaration of a state of emergency.

For example, the board agreed to close the public lobbies of the county water and sewer offices and county visitors’ centers until further notice.

Permits for events of 10 or more people were revoked until the end of April. No new permits of this kind will be issued until further notice.

Also, all non-essential county committee/board meetings were canceled for up to 30 days from Tuesday.

To stay updated and provide public guidance on coronavirus issues, the commission will hold emergency meetings at 8:30 a.m. March 24 and 31 in the County Administration Building in Shalimar.

During Tuesday’s commission meeting, Commissioner Carolyn Ketchel practiced social distancing by sitting next to one end of the dais rather than in her normal spot behind the dais.

Ketchel said she had just learned that a 34-year-old female friend of hers in Washington D.C. is ""extremely sick"" with the coronavirus. She also noted that the White House on Monday had released nationwide guidelines that recommend Americans to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people.

In response to a question from Commissioner Graham Fountain, Chapman said there currently is no specific answer to how long the virus threat will last.

""Right now, we’re looking at periods of two months at a time,"" she said. ""The (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is recommending gatherings of 50 or more to be canceled for at least the next six to eight weeks.

""We know so little about this virus, and so little about its patterns. Could it last until August? It could. If we don’t take some action now, we will prolong it at our local level.""

Before the board approved various state of emergency measures, Commissioner Nathan Boyles had asked Chapman if she had any specific recommendations the commission should take to protect the public against the virus.

""Think of this as a Category 5 hurricane coming at you,"" she said. ""This is an invisible virus coming at us. If it comes in and starts spreading, it will overwhelm our medical system.""

She added that the actions of social distancing ""may be pooh-poohed"" currently, but they are necessary.

""There has not been enough testing to know if (the virus is) spreading,"" in Florida, Chapman said. ""At minimum, I would take actions to minimize actions to limit social interactions in our community. We’ll reassess this on a weekly basis.""",193811,2020-03-19

NEW PORT RICHEY — Pasco County declared a local state of emergency Thursday morning, giving broad powers to its administrative staff to maintain public health in the wake of a Land O’ Lakes man contracting the coronavirus.

The declaration, approved by county commissioners in an emergency meeting, came at the request of the state Division of Emergency Management. It allows County Administrator Dan Biles and Emergency Management director Andrew Fossa to waive normal procedures to do what is considered necessary, including ordering curfews, to aid the state Department of Health during the outbreak.

The emergency declaration allows Biles and Fossa to waive purchasing procedures and other protocols related to performing public work, make emergency purchases, hire workers, make use of volunteers or other considerations. The county last declared a state of emergency in August in advance of Hurricane Dorian.

The declaration is in effect for seven days, but can be extended at the discretion of Biles or Foss.

With the Centers for Disease Control ""predicting that it is ‘likely’ that ‘widespread transmission’'' of coronavirus will occur in the United States, the resolution also urged local residents to follow the agency’s practical measures on hand washing, staying home when ill and other safeguards.

Earlier, Kurt Scheible, Pasco’s public transportation director, said county bus drivers have been given disinfectant wipes to clean steering wheels, fare boxes and the metal hand rails that riders use to board buses. Hand sanitizer always has been available on board for riders, he said.

In east Pasco, Saint Leo University said students, now on spring break, are being instructed to not return to the residential campus. Online classes will begin March 23.

Saint Leo education center students at Tampa (Channelside); MacDill Air Force Base; Lakeland; and the university’s sites on Pasco-Hernando State College campuses in New Port Richey, Spring Hill and Brooksville will begin online classes March 16.

A spokeswoman for PHSC, which is on spring break, said it is adhering to its normal schedule, as of Thursday afternoon.

Saint Leo University also canceled all large group events and suspended indefinitely off-season sports activities for fall and winter sports. Spring sports are continuing but no fans will be permitted to attend acrobatics and tumbling home events.

Pasco Tax Collector Mike Fasano said his office planned to send letters to motorists with birthdays in April and May. urging them to renew their motor vehicle tags and drivers licenses online or through the U.S. mail, if possible, rather than visiting one of his offices.

An earlier version of this story reported Saint Leo University had suspended all sports events indefinitely, but the suspension applies only to off-season activities for fall and winter sports.

BARTOW — The Polk County Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved County Manager Bill Beasley’s request to declare a local emergency to cope with the fast-moving COVID-19 crisis.

The vote came the day after Beasley announced closings of several county facilities. Beasley also told commissioners he was considering furloughing some county employees to limit the potential for the spread of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

“I believe these are trying times that demand challenging and unique solutions,” Beasley told commissioners. “This is a dynamic situation. It seems to be changing daily, sometimes hourly.”

Beasley announced the following closings of county facilities beginning Wednesday for a period of 30 days:

• All five community resource centers

• Both Adult Day Healthcare centers

• The Stuart Conference Center and other public meeting rooms at the county Agriculture Center in Bartow

• The exhibit hall and conference center at the Circle B Bar Reserve in Lakeland

The park and trails at Circle B will remain open to the public as will all other public trails and parks across the county, Beasley said.

In addition, the Rohr Home, a nursing facility, will be closed to visitors and new patients, he said.

Polk County Utilities will not disconnect service or charge its roughly 68,000 water and sewer customers late fees on overdue payments for the next 60 days, Beasley said.

All county offices will be open, although some with reduced staff, he said.

The exception is the offices of Polk County Property Appraiser Marsha Faux, who announced earlier she was shutting down to promote the social distancing recommended by state and federal health officials. The announcement on the Appraiser’s Office website did not say when it would re-open.

People can still do business with the Property Appraiser’s Office through the website, phone or regular mail and email, the announcement said.

Beasley also told commissioners he is considering a short-term “draw down” of the county’s roughly 1,850-person workforce as part of the county’s COVID-19 action plan.

After the meeting, Beasley told The Ledger he may consider putting some employees on a furlough for a period of time to reduce the number of person-to-person contacts that could spread the virus.

See The Ledger’s complete coverage of coronavirus

“The bottom line is the less contact we have with each other, the less opportunity for this to spread,” commission Chairman Bill Braswell said.

The furloughed workers would be told not to report to work and would be given some kind of compensation, said Beasley, who declined to discuss details.

The county manager said he has no idea how many, if any, county workers might be furloughed.

Beasley has asked top county managers to give him a list of employees who can work remotely from home, he said. Not until he gets that list later this week will he decide on furloughs.

The local emergency declaration allows Beasley to act on matters that would normally require county commission approval, County Attorney Michael Craig said. That includes purchasing decisions and providing emergency residential facilities and warehousing.

The emergency period can last only seven days but can be extended repeatedly by the county manager, he said.

“It’s anticipated it will need to be extended multiple times,” Craig said.

The extensions are subject to commission approval at its next regular meeting, Beasley said.

In other business, the commission approved extending its annual property insurance coverage for another year at $1.8 million, a roughly 6% increase over the current policy. It will cover all county buildings, which are valued at $850 million, said Mark Thomas, the county’s risk manager.

The insurance plan coverage was scheduled to increase 10% to $1.9 million, but the county reduced some coverage limits in line with neighboring counties and cities, Thomas said.

The state of emergency is in effect for seven days and can be renewed by another vote of the board of commissioners.

“Right now, there isn’t anything specific that we’re asking the board,” said County Administrator Bradley Arnold. “The state is directing us to remain focused on any (task) where we have the authority.”

He said the emergency status allows the county to respond quickly to direction from the state and federal government.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has asked restaurants to reduce capacity in half and the federal government has recommended that people avoid gatherings of more than 10 people.

Arnold said the directives cause a problem with the board’s next regular meeting scheduled for March 24. He said the 250-person capacity of the meeting room at the Everglades Recreation Center can be cut at least in half by setting up chairs farther apart.

But the county may not be able to further limit the number of people attending a public hearing. Teleconferencing is permitted for state agencies, but not for local governments, Arnold said.

“Would the governor consider waiving that provision?” he asked.

Arnold recommended going ahead with the March 24 meeting. The agenda includes a woman who seeks a zoning change for her mobile home and possible action on a drainage issue on SE 25th Street.

“It sounds like we have a fair amount of county business to discuss,” said Chairman Steve Printz. “It seems like we ought to get it done while we can.”

The county offers a great number of consolidated services for cities, including emergency dispatching and fire services, and Printz said that helps in responding to emergency situations like the Coronavirus.

“When you’re in an emergency, it’s too late (to consolidate),” he said.

Sumter County has no reported cases of the Coronavirus, unlike 28 other Florida counties, including Lake. Statewide, 2,294 people have been tested, 216 have tested positive and results are pending for 1,061 others, according to the Division of Disease Control and Protection of the Florida Department of Public Health.",107056,2020-03-19

CRAWFORDVILLE, Fla. (WCTV) — Wakulla County declared a local state of emergency Tuesday due to coronavirus.

Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for Florida on Monday, March 9, so the state can more rapidly respond to the coronavirus pandemic.

“Even though there have not been any confirmed cases in Wakulla County, it is our duty to take proactive measures for our Community,"" said County Administrator David Edwards. ""This declaration provides a method to take prudent action as necessary to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the County, and will allow the County to seek reimbursement from the federal government.""

Chairman Mike Stewart said the declaration is about keeping the county prepared to respond to coronavirus.

“This declaration is not meant to alarm anyone, and we expect life to be as normal as before. We are doing this in an abundance of caution, and this is to allow our County to have the means to respond to this unfortunate event,"" said Stewart.

The move is designed to limit large gatherings in the county, and also to limit contact between county government personnel and the public, as COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to public health.

RELATED: CORONAVIRUS NWF - What’s open & what’s not? - A list of closures and what is still open

The special called meeting only tangentially included any mention of the young spring break crowds now descending on the area. That reference came in a short statement from District 1 Commissioner Bill Chapman, currently chairman of the board of county commissioners.

RELATED: CLOSURES BAY AREA- Events, services, schools, canceled due to coronavirus concerns

""We would ask the board to recommend to all citizens and visitors and businesses to follow the directives and recommendations as set forth by the Centers for Disease Control (the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose guidance has included limiting public gatherings to less than 50 people, along with urging sick people to stay home),"" Chapman said.

Specifically, the local state of emergency cancels and suspends all events conducted under terms of county permits, and does the same with special events being conducted under the county’s beach activities ordinance.

Monday’s vote also suspends rental of all county facilities, suspends driving on the beach permits until Aug. 1, with a new lottery for those permits beginning on June 1, and extends dog on the beach permits for eight weeks, with no new permit applications accepted until June 1.

""Our idea is to minimize the contact between the public and staff the best we can,"" Walton County Administrator Larry Jones told commissioners prior to the vote.

""We want to serve the public,"" Jones continued. ""We want to make sure we take care of their needs. We believe most of these things are issues that will provide some protections to our county staff and citizens.""

The emergency declaration also moves a number of previously scheduled county government planning meetings, and cancels all meetings of volunteer boards and committees until May 1.

The scheduling of county commission meetings wasn’t specifically addressed in connection with the emergency declaration, although some commissioners did wonder about potential problems with commission meetings that might attract more than 50 people.

The emergency declaration has to be revisited every seven days, according to information from the Monday meeting, with either the chairman, the commission or the county administrator making decisions on its continuance.

In addition to the emergency declaration, the county will allow employees who can work from home to do so ""to provide that safety for our staff and our visitors,"" Jones said.

Monday’s meeting might not be the last time that commissioners are assembled to consider coronavirus-related action, Chapman told his colleagues Monday.

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Kelly Girtz scheduled an emergency meeting of the mayor and commission for Monday evening to approve a state of emergency for the city and to discuss a 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. The city’s government previously said it would be from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., but a later tweet corrected the time span.



UPDATE: Revised agenda posted to reflect the 7:00 p.m. time. Additionally, due to social distancing concerns, all input at the 5:00 p.m. meeting will be via written comment provided at the entrance or electronic comment. Both will be read into the record. https://t.co/jyDrtBTkbN pic.twitter.com/JtsMZHTwF0 — Athens-Clarke County (@accgov) March 16, 2020

Public gatherings were supposed to be limited to 50 people, but the commission instead banned gatherings of more than 10 people from 5 p.m. Tuesday to 5 a.m. April 7, according to the ordinance. The ban will apply to people in bars, restaurants and entertainment establishments but does not apply to employees.

This gathering ban and a voluntary 24-hour “shelter in place” policy replaced the initial discussed proposal of a mandatory curfew. To watch the full meeting, click here.

The overnight curfew would have made it “unlawful for any person to travel, loiter, wander or stroll in or upon the public streets, highways, roads, lanes, parks or other public grounds, public places, public buildings, places of amusement, eating places, vacant lots, or any other place during said declared emergency” between those hours.

In addition, the curfew’s proposal said it would have been “subject to certain exceptions and to provide for other purposes as may be necessary to preserve, protect and sustain the life, health, welfare and safety” of Athens citizens.

Three cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Athens, and 121 cases have been confirmed across the state.

Athens, home to the University of Georgia, has fewer people within its city limits than usual due to state universities suspending class for two weeks. Students are advised to stay away from campus, if possible.

In a Facebook post Monday, the Washington County Sheriff's Office says the Board of Commissioners consulted with the county Board of Health and Emergency Management Agency before declaring a state of emergency.

The declaration stops gatherings of 10 or more people including church services, funerals, family reunions, and political events starting Tuesday.

A curfew for nonessential travel was also issued between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., the Facebook post says. This does not include work-related travel and emergency situations. The curfew starts Monday night.

The post makes it clear the declaration does NOT stop businesses with 10 or more employees from operating.

This comes as the Georgia Department of Public Health reported the county's first confirmed case of COVID-19 Monday at noon.

The declaration is in place until further notice.

State Senator Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, said on Wednesday that he tested positive for coronavirus. Beach was at the Georgia Capitol on Monday for the special session.

He will now be in a 14-day quarantine at home. Beach released a statement:

""After experiencing a fever and cough, I sought medical attention last week. The diagnosis I was given was not coronavirus, but I did get tested for it on Saturday. With medication, I felt better by Monday and thought I was in the clear. Today, however, my test came back positive.

For now, I'm at home. I continue to suffer from a fever and cough, but I'm following doctor's orders, including the admonition to stay away from the hospital unless it becomes difficult to breathe. I know many Georgians are praying hard as we weather this crisis together, and frankly, I'd ask that they pray for me, as well as all the others in our state who are going through this right now – and those who soon will.

I know I face a difficult two weeks, but I'll work to keep everyone updated on my progress. With the support of my wife – who is keeping a safe distance and so far doesn't have symptoms – and my family and friends, I know I'll get through this and get back to work for my constituents.""

Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan released a statement Wednesday that said he will be in self-quarantine due to the positive test results from Beach.

New numbers released Thursday from the Georgia Department of Public Health show there have been 10 deaths and 287 cases of coronavirus across the state.

With the new cases, the DPH released the numbers of tests taken across the state, which totaled more than 1,800.

There have been 1,323 tests done in a commercial lab, with 174 coming in positive. The Department of Public Health Lab has done 508 tests, and had 113 positives.

The number of confirmed and presumed positive cases of COVID-19 rose from 197 on Wednesday to 287 cases in 28 counties on Thursday.

Fulton County has the most cases in the state with 66, followed by Cobb County with 37, Bartow with 26, DeKalb with 22, Dougherty with 20, Cherokee with 16, Gwinnett with 12, Fayette with nine, and Clarke with eight.

Globally, more than 222,000 people have been infected and more than 9,100 people have died from the new coronavirus, Johns Hopkins reported Thursday. Of that total, more than 9,400 confirmed cases are in the United States. There have been 150 deaths in the U.S. have been tied to the virus outbreak, as of Thursday morning.

Despite the emergency declaration, Dacula will still hold its local election on Tuesday. The city cites “express authorization” given by the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office on March 16 as its reason for proceeding with the vote despite concerns over the spread of the virus.

Emergency declarations give cities additional powers to hold meetings on short notice, use teleconferencing to reduce person-to-person contact and issue executive orders banning actions that could worsen the situation. Dacula’s emergency declaration does not directly address any of these options, but it still has these powers.

Snellville’s emergency declaration allows restaurants in city limits to sell unopened beer and wine and beer growlers to go. Snellville is not placing restrictions on group gatherings or movement, but encourages residents to shelter in place — not leave their homes unless necessary — and to practice social distancing.

Norcross, Lawrenceville, Duluth, Sugar Hill and Suwanee had previously issued state of emergency declarations. Each city is handling it slightly differently, with Suwanee and Duluth banning in-person dining but Lawrenceville officially discouraging it. Norcross’ police chief has discouraged residents from gathering in groups of 10 or more.

The announcement was made during a press conference at the South Central Health District.

What does that mean?

A curfew is now in place between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Non-essential travel is not allowed and that will be enforced by Dublin Police and the Laurens County Sheriff’s Office.

County leaders also moved to limit social gathering to just 10 people, and that includes church, funerals, etc.

In the press conference, health officials reiterated that there is NOT a known source for the two cases in Laurens County, so the hospital is considering it community spread.

The two patients are being kept in isolation at Fairview Park Hospital and no one can visit them.

The sheriff's office also said via Facebook that they will begin responding to non-emergency calls or minor crimes by phone, when possible, to limit exposure.

Deputies will continue to respond to all emergency calls and crimes that are essential for purposes of evidence collection or public safety.

The decision to respond will be on a case-by-case basis.

The Council had only two agenda items to discuss—temporarily limiting public access to City Hall and a state of emergency resolution.

Prior to a more than one-hour public discussion of the draft emergency resolution, the Council unanimously voted to close City Hall to the public until further notice, beginning at noon today. This follows earlier proactive steps taken by the city to prevent further spread of the Coronavirus by limiting public access at City Hall; encouraging online and payment drop-off options; and creating a virtual option for the March 19 Council meeting.

Mayor Sam Norton said, “As a small city, it’s critical that we keep our staff healthy to ensure continued services to our residents. We continue to closely monitor this situation with the help of our state and federal partners, but working together, we’ll all get through this.”

The draft emergency resolution is similar to actions taken across Georgia in communities, both rural and metropolitan, and in communities with confirmed diagnoses as well as communities with no confirmed cases. By declaring a state of emergency, it allows city officials to take necessary steps to ensure the overall health and welfare of city residents.

“This action isn’t something that we take lightly,” said Mayor Sam Norton. “None of us support government overreach, but in times like this, local governments must be empowered to take decisive actions when it comes to the public health and safety.”

Among the emergency measures to be considered by the Council during its next special called meeting on Wednesday, March 25 at 4:00 p.m.:

Permitting boards, commissions and agencies of the city to conduct meetings and take votes by teleconference.

Allowing the city manager, with approval of the mayor, to take necessary actions to protect the public health and safety including temporary closures of city facilities, cancelling certain city functions, and allowing staff and business to be conducted at alternative locations among other administrative and emergency actions necessary to protect the public health and perform essential functions.

Requiring restaurants to suspend dine-in services, but permitting delivery, drive-thru, or take-out services and to have patrons, employees and contractors maintain at least six (6) feet of personal distance.

Requiring gyms, fitness centers, and other high-contact business models to suspend daily operations.

Prohibiting public and private gatherings of more than 10 people, occurring outside a household (this provision would not prevent of business activity or the delivery of medical and other health services unless otherwise specified).

Further establishing the administrative succession roles, following the City Charter and current form of government, by designating the finance director to succeed the city manager if he is unable to perform his duties and if both the city manager and the finance director are unable to perform these duties, the mayor as chief executive officer of the city will assume the city manager duties.

Residents and business owners who would like to share feedback regarding the proposed emergency resolution can send comments to the City by email at customerservice@dahlonega.gov.

The possible state of emergency follows the Council’s March 19, 2020 special called meeting where the City Council unanimously approved two measures that assist with city efforts in responding to COVID-19 (Coronavirus). Those measures included a comprehensive employee telecommuting policy and a temporary moratorium on special event applications. Effective March 20, the city is no longer accepting new special event applications until further notice.

As part of these recent changes, all non-essential city staff will immediately shift to remote worksites, telecommuting from their homes.

“All essential city services continue to operate uninterrupted at this time,” said City Manager Bill Schmid. “Shifting non-essential employees out of our city facilities helps us limit potential exposure to essential staff, protecting their and the public’s health and working to ensure we can continue our core services.”

The Dahlonega Downtown Development Authority (DDA) recently notified city businesses that State of Georgia received its approved emergency declaration, making small businesses eligible to apply for Economic Injury Disaster Loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. Business owners can learn more and apply at https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela/.

The DDA staff is also working to identify other resources available to business owners during this difficult time. To learn more and to contact the DDA, email staff@dahlonegadda.org.

A post on the Monroe County Board of Commissioners Facebook page says the county’s state of emergency will remain in effect through midnight on Friday, April 10.

- Advertisement -

Monroe County interim Public Safety/Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Meadows says four things are accomplished by declaring a countywide state of emergency.

1.) Monroe County EMA can activate its Emergency Operations Plan.

2.) Commissioners have the authority to waive procedures and establish curfews (although commissioners decided not to implement a countywide curfew at this point).

3.) Establishes a voluntary daily shelter in place policy between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. that will take effect beginning at 9 p.m. on Wednesday, March 25.

4.) Prohibits gatherings of 10 persons or more, including in local restaurants and churches. However, grocery stores, fuel stations, pharmacies and health and medical care facilities are excluded.

Exclusions to the voluntary shelter in place policy include:

1.) traveling to and from an emergency funeral,

2.) traveling to and from work,

3.) traveling to and from activities involving the exercise of First Amendment rights,

4.) interstate and intrastate vehicular travel through Monroe County,

5.) walking/running for physical exercise,

6.) traveling to procure food,

7.) traveling to seek medical attention,

8.) emergency services personnel executing this order,

9.) activities relating to agriculture, forestry and tending or caring for crops and livestock.

Meadows told commissioners he dislikes calling for emergency declarations because it’s indicative of a problem but that in this instance it’s in the county’s best interest to protect the lives of citizens and to reduce Coronavirus spread.

“Protection of life is the highest priority for limiting the effects of COVID-19,” Meadows said.

Monday’s resolution came nine days after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared a statewide public health emergency on March 14. Kemp is expected to hold a press conference at 5 p.m. Monday, March 23, during which further statewide restrictions could be implemented.

“Any stricter guidelines Kemp implements pertaining to curfews or shelter in place policies would supersede the county’s declaration,” the post said.",26984,2020-03-25

SANDPOINT — Bonner County declared a local state of emergency Tuesday due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The declaration mainly opens up the county’s spending authority and eases other requirements so the county can respond quickly to the pandemic. It also allows for the county to be reimbursed for expenses it incurs because of COVID-19.

“Basically, it gives us the ability if we have to spend any money on this issue — which we may or may not — it can be a reimbursable amount that can be given back to county taxpayers,” Commissioner Dan McDonald said on Tuesday.

McDonald gave the heads-up about the declaration on social media on Monday to allay concerns that it would infringe on residents’ rights. He called the declaration a standard operating procedure, which follows Gov. Brad Little’s statewide emergency declaration.

“I put it out last night on Facebook that it was coming because I didn’t want people to panic. It’s SOP,” he said.

Idaho has nine laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus, the Idaho Department of Health & Welfare said on Tuesday. Seventy-six people are being monitored by Idaho public health officials and 39 people are no longer being monitored.

A total of 295 people have been tested through the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories and another 58 people have been tested through commercial labs, according to Health & Welfare’s novel coronavirus online update page (coronavirus.idaho.gov)

Counties with confirmed cases include Ada, Blaine, Madison and Teton.

While there are no reported cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in North Idaho, both state and local agencies are already taking steps to limit the virus’ spread and ensure that resources are available to handle such an event.

The Shoshone County Board of County Commissioners announced Monday afternoon that they would be following the lead of Idaho Gov. Brad Little and other Idaho counties by declaring a state of emergency outlined in Idaho Code § 46-1011 and all relevant sections of Idaho Code.

“The county views its leadership role in times like this as being very crucial,” said BOCC Chairman Mike Fitzgerald. “We are taking necessary, early and aggressive action against the virus.”

Specifically, Fitzgerald added, Shoshone County is implementing measures that are recommended by health organizations to slow the spread of the virus and to reduce the number of people who would ultimately get sick.

There are no known suspected cases of COVID-19 within Shoshone County as of Monday, but this emergency declaration allows county officials and related emergency personnel to activate additional resources and communication measures to ensure the public is regularly informed.

“In doing so, it emphasizes the risks that the virus presents and urges persons to take precautions if they have reason to believe they were infected,” Fitzgerald said.

A news release on Monday from the county states that an emergency action plan is being implemented in order to minimize non-essential government functions and in-person interaction among the county departments. Based upon the emergency action plan, the following non-essential county services will be suspended until further notice:

• Driver’s Licensing and Motor Vehicle Services (in-person)

• Notaries Public

• Jail visitation

• Jury duty

Elected officials plan to meet regularly to monitor the situation and discuss emergency plan implementation measures as the matter develops.

Anyone who meets high risk criteria pursuant to the recommendations of Panhandle Health District and the CDC will have limited access to the Shoshone County Courthouse and related public buildings. See the News-Press story regarding school/business closures in the Silver Valley for more information on PHD recommendations.

Members of the public are encouraged to use telephone or other electronic communications to contact county offices.

The county will take all necessary steps to assist in providing options for the public to deliver documents and address other matters that require in-person processing. This and other information will be published on the Shoshone County website at www.shoshonecounty.id.gov and additional notifications will be made as the situation changes.

As of Monday, these precautionary measures are being implemented through April 10.",12690,2020-03-18

First, words like States of Emergency and shelter in place don’t mean “lockdown” or “martial law”. Often, a state of emergency is declared because it makes it legally easier to receive disaster assistance. At the moment, the City of Twin Falls is down a couple of firefighters. They were exposed last week to a patient with COVID-19. The city doesn’t have a lot of firefighters to spare. And as some of you know, voters rejected plans for the construction of detox units at fire stations. These would be used by staff returning from calls.

It’ll be at the ready if and when the county would need to respond to a potential outbreak.

Twin Falls County will today join the city in considering a State of Emergency.

It’ll be at the ready if and when the county would need to respond to a potential outbreak. This could happen among county departments and offices or even inside an overcrowded jail. The latter would require protective gear for medical personnel and Jail Deputies.

Such an order from the County Commission would speed purchase of supplies.

Some county offices are already limiting public contact. You would see this at the licensing division of the DMV, and I believe the Buhl DMV is restricting public access.

One other interesting point, if cases of coronavirus peak later this week, as some expect, then any States of Emergency in the Magic Valley may be short in duration.

They added that ""Kane County has limited funding and resources to respond to this pandemic, and by making a formal declaration under Section 11 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act the County is enabled the County to respond best to protect the interests and safety of its residents.""",523643,2020-03-19
"129","Illinois","Lake","https://patch.com/illinois/lakeforest/gyms-ordered-closed-lake-bluff-declares-coronavirus-emergency","Gyms Ordered Closed As Lake Bluff Declares Coronavirus Emergency","LAKE BLUFF, IL — Village trustees voted unanimously via speakerphone at an emergency village board meeting Wednesday to amend the Lake Bluff municipal code to expand the definition of a civil emergency to include epidemics of infectious diseases.

Village President Kathy O'Hara then declared such an emergency in response to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. Trustees then extended the state of emergency until the end of the next village board meeting. O'Hara was the only elected official to attend the meeting in person.

""The Illinois Department of Public Health has now confirmed localized community person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in Illinois, significantly increasing the risk of exposure and infection to Illinois' general public, and creating an extreme public health risk in the village and throughout the state,"" O'Hara said, in the declaration.

As of 3 p.m. Wednesday, there were 22 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, among Lake County residents, according to the Lake County Health Department. The department learned of the first infected county resident a week earlier.

""As has been experienced in other locales in the United States and around the world, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to infect large numbers of people in a short amount of time, placing extreme burdens on the health care system and the economy,"" O'Hara declared.

In her first set of emergency orders, O'Hara mandated the closure of all physical fitness facilities and membership sports and recreation clubs starting Thursday.

Zak Rivera, owner of Focused Results Personal Training, addressed the board before the vote. He explained the basis of his fitness business was one-on-one training and there was never more than eight people present at one time. Amid concerns over the coronavirus, he said about half of the sessions conducted by personal trainers at his facility have been conducted online and virtual.



""We've been diligent and we understand the severity of the issue, and we're just trying to operate our business as any small business owner would like to do, and also take care of our clients,"" Rivera said, asking the village president to allow him to stay open and offering to adhere to additional hygienic restrictions.

""We're trying to have our clients be safe as well as our trainers, but as our trainers — and obviously myself and my wife who own the space — are reliant on our doors to be open, or at least to be able to do virtual sessions,"" he said. ""In order to pay the trainers, for them to make a living, for us to make a living, it's pretty much imperative that we have that ability to be able to operate our business to some degree.""

O'Hara said she truly appreciated Rivera's concerns. Later in the meeting, a trustee asked the village president if an exception could be made for local small businesses to conduct one-on-one training.

""I am certainly not thrilled about having to do this declaration. But I am closing them all, and that is under my authority to do so,"" O'Hara said.



Despite the hardship for affected businesses and workers, O'Hara said the public's health and safety were the paramount concerns of village leaders.

""I truly believe that at this point in time we have to do this,"" O'Hara said. ""I am hoping that it will not be for a long duration, and I truly understand how this will affect a lot of local businesses and everything else — both locally and nationally.""

The declaration also authorized emergency purchasing and staffing measures for village employees in the police and public works departments, as needed, to protect health and safety.

The amendment to the village code and emergency declaration is essentially identical to similar such ordinances incorporated by other suburban municipal clients of Elrod Friedman, recently co-founded by Lake Bluff's village attorney. The changes define civil emergencies and extraordinary emergency authorities.



The Illinois Municipal Code grants local governments the power to declare their own states of emergency, and the firm encouraged all its municipal clients to update their codes to include the authority, according to co-founder Steve Elrod.

The order to close gyms in Lake Bluff follows the closures of Lake Bluff village, park district and library facilities to the public.

Gov. JB Pritzker issued a disaster declaration on March 9 and subsequent emergency orders that mandated the statewide closure of all public and private schools, a ban on gatherings of 50 or more people and a restriction on dine-in service at bars and restaurants.

In Highland Park, Mayor Nancy Rotering ordered all health clubs, movie theaters and live performance venues closed by the end of the day Tuesday after declaring a state of emergency over the weekend.

Lake Forest has closed all city playgrounds and all non-essential municipal buildings, and fire department officials have asked residents to limit calls to 911 to true medical emergencies, according to an announcement from city staff. Emergency personnel and public health officials requested that those experiencing only mild symptoms stay home and try to avoid infecting others.

Dr. Sana Ahmed, medical epidemiologist at the Lake County Health Department, asked those showing mild COVID-19 symptoms — fever, coughing, shortness of breath — to distance themselves from others in their household and using a separate bedroom and bathroom when possible. Call a doctor if the symptoms worsen.

""We are prioritizing testing for symptomatic people who have high risk of complications — older adults living in congregate settings and those with chronic health conditions like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, and those with weakened immune systems,"" Ahmed said in a release.

The moves are an effort to maximize social distancing practices, reduce the rate the coronavirus spreads in the general population and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed, a public health intervention often referred to as ""flattening the curve.""

O'Hara was joined behind the dais by Village Administrator Drew Irvin and Village Attorney Peter Friedman at Wednesday afternoon's emergency meeting. They maintained a distance of at least six feet, as recommended by public health officials, to minimize the risks of transmitting the virus to one another.



""The most important message is that our residents need to stay home,"" O'Hara said in a release announcing the emergency declaration.

Trustees were able to vote over the phone thanks to an executive order by the governor. The next Lake Bluff Village Board meeting is tentatively set for April 13.

"131","Illinois","McHenry","https://patch.com/illinois/crystallake/il-coronavirus-mchenry-county-teen-among-new-cases","Coronavirus In IL: State Of Emergency Declared In McHenry County","MCHENRY COUNTY, IL — McHenry County Board Chairman Jack Franks declared a state of emergency Wednesday for McHenry County in response to the county's first presumptive case of coronavirus, which activates the emergency operations plans of the McHenry County Department of Health and McHenry County Emergency Management Agency and requests state and federal funding and resources to combat a potential outbreak, according to a news release from government officials.

This declaration comes less than 24 hours after county health officials confirmed a teen tested positive at the Illinois Department of Public Health laboratory for coronavirus. According to the MCDH, the teen has no history of traveling to an affected area and isn't connected to anyone with a known case of COVID-19.

The teen is in isolation and doing well, health officials said, adding that they are identifying and investigating all who've been in contact with him.

According to the government news release, Franks made the declaration upon the joint recommendation of county public health administrator Melissa Adamson and EMA director David Christensen.



""Declaring a state of emergency is not a decision to be made lightly,"" Franks said, in the news release. ""However, with a McHenry County resident now presumptively diagnosed with coronavirus, I have the responsibility to ensure that we can bring all available local, state and federal resources to bear to blunt the impact and bring this to as quick of a conclusion as possible.""

Marengo added that the declaration shouldn't cause panic or alarm and emphasized Gov. J.B. Pritzker's call for levelheadedness and calm while ""staying abreast of new developments and taking common-sense precautions.""

As for the county's first case, Adamson said they don't have much information currently, but are taking all necessary precautions with the case.

""We encourage all residents to continue using preventative measures to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19 and to begin planning for events that could disrupt their lives, such as school closures or if they become ill,"" Adamson said in the news release.



More:

County health officials said they will continue to partner with state and regional health departments to monitor all possible new cases as this situation continues to evolve. Residents should continue to use precautions (see below) in their daily routine to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, and they should begin developing a plan should they become ill.

Quick tips for:

Everyone: Use the same daily health precautions you would for flu including washing your hands frequently, for a minimum of 20 seconds, using soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering your cough and sneeze, and staying home when sick.

Health care: Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of respiratory illness such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing; wear proper personal protective gear such as gowns and masks when needed, and have employees stay home when sick.

Day cares, schools, universities: Review emergency plans, absenteeism policies, and cleaning procedures; identify strategies for alternative learning mechanisms such as on-line programs; and consider postponing or cancelling student exchange programs.

Businesses: Review emergency and continuity of operation plans, revisit sick leave policies, and assess schedule flexibility.

Community and faith organizations: Review emergency plans and communicate with community members if events and services are changed, postponed, or cancelled.Get the latest

Meanwhile, Illinois' case count jumped from 7 cases to 19 cases since Friday as the illness spread outside Cook County.

More cases of coronavirus in Illinois include the first outside of Cook County, Pritzker said Tuesday, including a Kane County woman in her 60s. Like the McHenry County teen, the Kane County woman has no history of recent travel or contact with any other coronavirus patients, and does not work in healthcare, Pritzker said.



As another eight cases brought Illinois' coronavirus case count to 19, Illinois officials say there is growing evidence of community transmission — in other words, coronavirus spreading among those who haven't traveled to high-risk areas but contracted it at home.

On Tuesday afternoon, The City of Crystal Lake said they're actively monitoring the activities associated with the spread of coronavirus.



""The McHenry County Department of Health (MCDH) is the lead agency for infectious disease in McHenry County and the City is coordinating its efforts with their guidance along with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and IL Dept. of Public Health (IDPH),"" the City wrote in a Facebook post. ""The City has been monitoring the situation and has been in contact with MCDH, IDPH, State of Illinois, and federal agencies, to be informed of the most recent information available.""



The City also provided a list of local, national and worldwide health sources for residents to gather information from.

""The City has operational plans in place to ensure the delivery of essential City services should an outbreak occur in our community.""

Also on Tuesday, officials in McHenry County announced the relocation of polling places from Valley Hi Nursing Home and three other senior care facilities as a precaution to protect their residents from coronavirus.

According to the news release from McHenry County, officials decided to ""act proactively to move polling places for the Tuesday, March 17 primary from the county-owned Valley Hi and the three private facilities to alternate locations"" even while they believe the risk to the County remains low.

""It's out of an abundance of caution for a high-risk population, and following the recommendations of the IDPH and the CDC, Valley Hi requested that the polling location be moved at this time,"" Valley Hi Administrator Tom Annarella said, in the news release.

On the other side of Lebanon, at the county fairgrounds workers were cleaning up one of the biggest exhibition buildings. If needed this will become an emergency hospital.

If there is a coronavirus outbreak and the local hospital is overwhelmed, less seriously ill patients could be treated there.

“We can monitor their health to ensure people are getting the best care instead versus being at home,” Peppin said.

Fairgrounds facilities Manager Jack Jones never imagined he would be setting up a hospital.

“If we do everything the way we should and act with a little common sense, we will get through this.” he said.

But it won’t be easy. Peppin received two death threats from people angered by the government-imposed restrictions on business and services.

Wochit

BUCYRUS - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Crawford County commissioners have declared a state of emergency.

Commissioners voted on the resolution implementing the county's emergency plan following a Monday morning meeting with county department heads and elected officials.

The state of emergency is intended to enable the county to receive any state or federal funding that may become available, the resolution states. It increases the purchasing authority for costs related to the emergency to $100,000, with three informal estimates required.

Also Monday, Judge Sean Leuthold of Common Pleas Court issued an order closing the Crawford County Courthouse to employees as well as the general public on Fridays, with the exception of the board of elections office, which will continue to process absentee ballots. The courthouse was closed to the public last week.

Local response to Coronavirus: Bucyrus and Crawford County coronavirus cancellations and closings

""Any statutory deadline or limitation that occurs on a Friday, while the courthouse is closed, shall be extended to the following Monday,"" Leuthold's order states.

During the Monday meeting, Commissioner Doug Weisenauer explained that all elected officials would have to issue a declaration for their respective departments.

Leuthold led much of the discussion as the county leaders weighed options for issues raised by closing the courthouse, which county employees would be considered essential and required to work Monday through Thursdays and how they'd be compensated for time off.

Ultimately, each elected official will decide what happens in his or her department.

""We're all going to have to make some sacrifices; it can't be perfect,"" Sean Leuthold said. He suggested that department heads continue to come into the office on Fridays, saying that was what he intends to do.

For days when the courthouse is open, the possibility of rotating employees — having them work on alternate days — was discussed as an option for ensuring employees are treated fairly.

The consensus of the meeting was that county employees who are told not to report to work will be paid.

""The overriding public policy is as follows: Have less people here, but don't punish them economically,"" said Judge Shane Leuthold of Crawford County Municipal Court.

""This is an extraordinary situation, right?"" Sean Leuthold said. ""We're not going to be able to make sure every little tiny thing is going to be fair and equitable for every single person. There may be some employee who somehow doesn't get exactly what another employee gets. ... If we're going to try to craft a policy that does that, we're not going to get it done.""

Kate Siefert, commissioner of Crawford County Public Health, said the plan being discussed would meet the guidelines set forth by the Ohio Department of Health.

""There's not one-fits-all for any of this,"" she said. ""We are going to have factories that have to stay open and cannot meet social distancing. That's reality.""

In those cases, things such as hand-washing, the use of hand sanitizer and other measures become more important, she said. ""People that have to work just have to be more conscientious about it,"" she said.

She also urged county leaders to plan for essential employees to be absent at some point.

""If there is only one person that knows how to do your HVAC, you need to cross-train,"" she urged.

"137","Indiana","Decatur","https://www.wcmessenger.com/articles/decatur-declares-health-emergency/","Decatur declares health emergency","The City of Decatur has declared a public health emergency related to COVID-19.

The city council Monday night approved a declaration of local disaster effective 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, March 24.

The declaration basically supports the disaster declaration approved by the county earlier on Monday while allowing the city to be able to control its own processes.

Notably, it echoes the county’s call to cancel gatherings of more than 10 people, based on CDC social distancing guidelines.

It also notes that city services required to maintain the health, safety and welfare of the public will remain open to the public, but facilities that are deemed not to provide essential services — the conference center and public library — will remain closed to the public until further notice.

The declaration also allows the mayor to direct the city manager to extend the time for payment of utility bills for those who provide documentation of hardship due to the virus.

Decatur city attorney Patricia Adams said it allows the city to take some steps to make sure they don’t have people’s water being cut off, for example.

“As we all know, people are losing jobs or being furloughed for a couple of weeks, and you certainly want them to keep their water for quality of life and so they can remain healthy,” she said.

Also, the declaration postpones all nonessential municipal court proceedings.

It also allows the city to cancel meetings for the remainder of March, April and May. However, since some council business will likely be required in that time frame, the mayor still has the authority to call a meeting when necessary.

Decatur Fire Chief Nate Mara, who is identified in the declaration as the city’s emergency management coordinator, said people need to understand the severity of the situation.

“We still run across people who are not taking this seriously,” he said. “To help keep our health system floating, people need to be taking it seriously.”

He said that while as of 5 p.m. Monday, Wise County did not have any confirmed cases of COVID-19, it’s important to do whatever we can to slow down the number of cases to flatten the curve so that the health care system does not become overwhelmed.

Decatur Police Captain Delvon Campbell said it is just a matter of time before Wise County has confirmed cases.

“I would be extremely surprised if this county does not have reports of it coming up soon, because I agree people are not taking it as serious as what they should be. Parking lots at places are still full. The reality is if we can just listen and abide by these declarations we could truly knock the curve down,” he said.

In separate COVID-19-related action, the council voted to postpone the May 2 city council election until Nov. 3.",26277,NA

Under Thurmond’s executive order, residents are asked to “shelter in place as much as possible” and follow a “voluntary curfew” that will run from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. every day. Businesses deemed “non-essential” are also ordered to close during those hours. Effective Tuesday, public gatherings of 10 or more people will be prohibited and businesses like bowling alleys, gyms, fitness centers, nail salons, spas and other personal grooming facilities will be ordered to keep their occupancy below that threshold.

Restaurants, breweries and bars will be prohibited from offering dine-in service and restricted to take-out and delivery. They will also be allowed to sell unopened wine and beer for consumption off-site.

Thurmond also says, Workforce DeKalb “will immediately utilize $1.3 million to assist DeKalb workers dislocated from their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.”

“While COVID-19 is a serious threat to public health, we cannot ignore the realities of the economic fallout so many businesses and employees are experiencing,” Thurmond said in a news release. “We are experiencing parallel health and economic crises.”

What is not clear is if the City of Atlanta will institiute a voluntary curfew.

As of 1:00 PM, there are 41,026 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States. There are 772 confirmed cases in the state of Georgia.

""This is a difficult but necessary decision to indefinitely close dining service inside restaurants and bars in Franklin. Gyms and fitness centers in the city limits will be closed as well.

Mayor Ken Moore also advised those returning from a vacation during spring break to self-isolate and use physical distancing for 14 days, especially those who were in large crowds or flying.

“While this is a difficult and uncertain time, the only way to stop the spread and save lives is to take strong action now,"" Moore said.

City leaders met — several feet apart from one another — on Monday evening to unanimously declare a local emergency, approve a three-pronged emergency response plan and officially launch the next phase of that program.

The vote triggered the cancellation of all non-essential recreational services at city libraries and community centers. Library late fees and holds are suspended during the closure.

Huntington Beach already had suspended all library events through April 12.

Essential senior care services, including health checks, transit and meal services, will continue, according to the city’s new response website, HBready.com.

City Manager Oliver Chi added that the city will begin reassigning staff members from departments affected by closures to help serve residents considered more at risk of serious effects from the coronavirus-caused respiratory disease COVID-19 (those in their 60s or older who have preexisting health issues) and create new programs to address the growing problem.

“[Impacts of social distancing are] creating just unprecedented social upheaval right now,” Chi said. “There’s no way to mitigate those impacts, but the silver lining right now is all the different levers that government can try to influence are being pulled to try to mitigate the issues that people are experiencing.”

Following the lead of state and federal officials, Huntington Beach is asking the community to cancel gatherings of 250 or more people, or gatherings of 10 or more people by organizations that serve the higher-risk population.

The City Council’s discussion of specific responses to the coronavirus were punctuated with figures about the virus’s potentially devastating effects.

Fire Chief Scott Haberle said the Orange County healthcare system doesn’t have the capacity to deal with critical-care patients at the potential rate. About 15% of Orange County’s population of about 3 million is 65 or older, according to U.S. Census estimates as of July 1. But the number of staffed hospital and intensive care unit beds in the county amounts to about 5,500, Haberle said.

“The reality is, we can’t build more hospitals overnight,” Haberle said. “We really need to slow the spread of the disease going forward.”

Hotels and other tourist-oriented businesses that pay into the city’s transient occupancy tax are expected to see a sharp decline in revenue due to fewer people traveling — at least a 20% decrease in reservations over the next 3½ months, Chi projected.

Officials estimated a loss of $2.5 million to $3 million in the transient occupancy tax, plus $1 million to $1.5 million in sales taxes, for a total loss of $3.5 million to $4.5 million for the city.

“The local hotel industry in Huntington Beach is really one of the bedrocks of our local economy,” Chi said. “Those ripples go throughout our entire economy.”

The city has been in touch with the Small Business Administration to help local businesses access funding, Chi said.

As part of its response plan, the city also will cancel all work travel, not schedule events with more than 50 people and potentially cancel some commission and community support meetings. City staff also is meeting with community groups, such as the local interfaith council, to coordinate responses for higher-risk populations, Chi said.

“We kind of do what we’re doing here, so it’s not so much worried about us getting the flu or me getting the flu, it’s me transmitting it to somebody else who may not have the wherewithal to combat it,” Councilman Mike Posey said.

The state of emergency authorizes Jackson County to perform several actions, including the following:

Emergency procurement of goods and services.

Entering into mutual aid agreements between the County and cities within the County or neighboring counties.

Enforcing emergency measures to protect the public.

Modifying relevant personnel leave, personnel processes or policies, and workplace requirements, assignments, or designations of County employees.

Requesting assistance and potential reimbursements from the State of Oregon and any appropriate Federal agency for response and recovery.

Monroe County interim Public Safety/Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Meadows says four things are accomplished by declaring a countywide state of emergency.

1.) Monroe County EMA can activate its Emergency Operations Plan.

2.) Commissioners have the authority to waive procedures and establish curfews (although commissioners decided not to implement a countywide curfew at this point).

3.) Establishes a voluntary daily shelter in place policy between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. that will take effect beginning at 9 p.m. on Wednesday, March 25.

4.) Prohibits gatherings of 10 persons or more, including in local restaurants and churches. However, grocery stores, fuel stations, pharmacies and health and medical care facilities are excluded.

Exclusions to the voluntary shelter in place policy include:

“Protection of life is the highest priority for limiting the effects of COVID-19,” Meadows said.

Monday’s resolution came nine days after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared a statewide public health emergency on March 14. Kemp is expected to hold a press conference at 5 p.m. Monday, March 23, during which further statewide restrictions could be implemented.

It comes on the heels of Gov. Bill Lee signing executive order No. 17 and is effective immediately.

“For the first time in Tipton County, we are now, likely, experiencing community transmission of the virus,” Huffman said. “This means that the virus is no longer only being transmitted from someone who has traveled outside the county. Considering that, I have taken these dramatic and unprecedented steps to keep the citizens of Tipton County safe.”

Under the new declaration and executive order, changes will be made to business operations, there are prohibitions for social gatherings and the county government has suspended some of its legally-required procedures.

What it means for the public and businesses

Lee’s order prohibits gathering in groups larger than 10 people. Blood drives are an exception to this.

His order also calls on businesses across the state to use alternative business models beginning at midnight CDT on Monday, March 23 until midnight CDT April 6. Businesses are encouraged to enact policies that take extra steps to assist vulnerable populations by considering measures such as shopping hours exclusive from the general public.

Both orders state restaurants should provide drive-thru, take-out and delivery services only. The county’s declaration does not mention this, but Lee’s order states establishments may sell alcohol by take-out or delivery (with the purchase of food) in closed containers to those who are age 21 and up.

Bars and gyms should close their facilities until further notice. Lee encourages gym owners to pursue digital programming if possible.

Visitation to nursing homes, retirement homes and long-term care or assisted-living facilities is now limited to visits involving essential care only.

“Additional closures may be required depending upon the results of further medical testing for this virus,” Tipton County’s declaration reads.

What it means for Tipton County government

The public health emergency declaration gives the county government, its departments and agencies the authorization to seek any and all necessary federal and state funding. It also suspends the regularly required procedures and regulations necessary to purchase equipment, materials, supplies and services needed for emergency management.

The Tipton County Emergency Management Agency is authorized to exercise all powers and authority granted to it by law.

It also states the county executive shall use all the resources available to the office to protect the health and welfare of the people of Tipton County.

“This virus is going to peak and then decline,” said Huffman. “We will get through this and my prayer is that once this emergency has passed, the people of Tipton County will swarm to local businesses to do their shopping and support the many, small, local businesses that have been devastated by this health challenge.

EVANSVILLE, Ind. — Seated about six feet apart from one another, the three Vanderburgh County Commissioners solemnly voted Monday to declare a State of Emergency due to the coronavirus spread.

The declaration, which has the force of the law, applies to the City of Evansville, as well. Mayor Lloyd Winnecke endorsed the move, citing public health officials' plea that citizens not congregate in large numbers.

City and county governments are following Gov. Eric Holcomb's newest order of limiting public gatherings to 50.

The declaration means the Civic Center is closed to the public. Government employees will still work, although some may do so offsite. Officials stressed local government is not closing, and many services are available online.

Other public facilities that will temporarily close include Mesker Park Zoo & Botanic Garden, Swonder Ice Arena, the Old Courthouse, Lloyd Pool, C.K. Newsome Center and Old National Events Plaza.

The State of Emergency also means local government officials can bypass some normal procedures if need be.

""This situation requires rapid decision-making,"" County Commissioners President Jeff Hatfield said. ""This declaration will allow this government to act in a very quick manner. Before county government would be very cumbersome and somewhat tied in its reaction time to this. This declaration will free us of that, and it's necessary for the public's health.""

The declaration is for seven days and may be renewed in seven-day increments as needed. After about 15 minutes, Monday's emergency meeting of County Commissioners was recessed, not adjourned.

State officials made clear Monday that community spread of coronavirus has arrived in Indiana, that it goes from person to person, and it's not always obvious where a person acquired the virus.

Vanderburgh County Health Officer Dr. Ken Spear told County Commissioners Monday that there's no vaccine for coronavirus and social distancing is needed to slow the spread.

Hatfield, Winnecke and others cited the need to follow the direction of Spear and health experts at the state level.

They noted Holcomb's decision to close restaurants and bars, except for carryout, to contain the virus.

Winnecke said it's reasonable to believe the virus exists in Evansville and Vanderburgh County, even though there has not been a confirmed positive test yet.

""I'm on daily calls with the health department as well as our two hospitals,"" Winnecke said. ""My understanding is they have a number of tests out to be examined. Not to speak on their behalf, but yes, I think it's safe to assume the virus is probably in our community. It's safe to assume that.""

Hatfield said it is important that businesses continuing to operate follow Occupational Health and Safety Administration guidelines to protect their employees.

Winnecke encouraged the public to continue to patronize local small businesses, and he asked the Southwest Indiana Chamber to help develop a list of restaurants with carryout availability.

""I still believe if we're calm and flexible, we will all prevail,"" the mayor said. ""These actions today, while somewhat dramatic, are meant to be precautionary.""

Whitley County Judge-Executive Pat White, Jr. signed an order Friday declaring a state of emergency in the county.

While the measure does grant White, as the local chief executive officer, a number of additional powers as such as the power to establish curfews, to prohibit or limit the sale or consumption of goods, and to seize, take or condemn property, White said the sole purpose of the declaration was to make federal and state resources available to first responders, medical personnel and the hospital.

Specifically, White said it will permit officials to request triage tents should the number of coronavirus cases overwhelm Baptist Health Corbin’s capacity.

“It would only be in the event there was dire need,” White said.

“I’m not taking any action on any increased authority at this point,” he said.

White took similar action following the heavy flooding across the area in February.

Reynolds announced the case was linked to Dallas County, which includes Des Moines' western suburbs. In a news conference Sunday, Cownie said that case ""opened a lot of people’s eyes.""

""That, I think, steps it up to a level we should all be concerned about: how we gather, where we gather and to respect that social distancing that we all should have,” he said.

The proclamation forces the cancellation of the 2020 St. Patrick's Day Parade, which was scheduled to close several streets downtown Tuesday during working hours.

A block party on Court Avenue, hosted annually by Annie's Irish Pub, was also planned for Tuesday, but the bar decided earlier Sunday that it would postpone the party.

The Des Moines Public Library system, citing Cownie's declaration, announced Sunday it would close all six of its locations until further notice. It urged patrons to continue to access resources through its website, https://www.dmpl.org/.

“All indications are that aggressive early social distancing can stop this virus from spreading exponentially, and we believe the library has a responsibility to play a role in that here in Des Moines,” library director Susan Woody said in a statement.

Cownie estimated the proclamation could remain in place for at least a couple weeks and last up to two months. He referenced the 1918 flu pandemic, saying cities that enacted social distancing quickly fared better than those that didn't.

“I think we have to be very careful with this,” he said.

Those who paid for event permits to hold their events on public land can get refunds upon request, according to the proclamation.

The fifth-term mayor urged residents to also avoid large gatherings on private property. (The declaration doesn't ban gatherings of 250 or more people on private land.)

He also cautioned people who might want to go to a local bar or restaurant to enjoy the St. Patrick's Day holiday. Over the weekend, revelers across the country still went out to bars and nightclubs despite the spread of the virus.

“I’d suggest they hopefully respect the health and well-being of their friends and associates and anyone they come in contact with. I would think they would want to maintain this social distancing for their own health and well-being,” he said.

Parade canceled for first time

After holding off on canceling the annual Des Moines St. Patrick's Day Parade, the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of Central Iowa's board voted Sunday morning to forgo the annual tradition.

Tony Schmid, president of the group, said 2020 is the first time the parade has been canceled since it was founded in the 1980s. He didn't rule out holding it at a later date.

“This is definitely the first time we’ve canceled it, and we’re very sad to do so,” he said at the city's news conference Sunday.

Schmid added that the majority of people who reached out to him wanted the parade to go on. However, he was only expecting 1,000 attendees, at most, because of the virus and the potential for rain. On a nice day, Schmid said 20,000 to 30,000 will line the streets.

Although other similar events were canceled or postponed nationwide earlier in the week, the parade was still on schedule. Schmid was talking with both the city and the governor's office, hoping to hold off as long as possible for better news.

“We were ready to pull the plug at the very last minute if it was left up to us, but we decided, as the group, that we didn’t want to move forward with it,” he said.

He and the mayor then offered up their closing remarks in a mostly empty City Hall. Moments later, a city employee appeared with disinfectant wipes to clean off the city's video equipment.

In a special session, Commissioners declared a state of local public health emergency for 60 days or until they are able to recover.

During this time, all non-essential businesses can remain open but will have to prohibit the public from being allowed within their facility.

This goes for bars, restaurants and car repair shops.

Other non-essential businesses like libraries, gyms, and hair salons will have to completely shut down.

The resolution passed 4-1, with commissioner Ed Myer dissenting.

While four of the five voted for the approval, not all were completely in agreement. Commissioner Dan Woydziak did it but felt obligated to do so.

""I’ll vote for the resolution because we’re forced into a corner where we have no choice,"" Woydziak said.

With the state’s decisions of declaring a state of emergency last week and then with Governor Laura Kelly closing the state’s school buildings on Tuesday, the board met on Thursday morning to address the pressing need of a declaration for the county.

The declaration comes six days after a Butler County man tested positive for COVID-19 and two days after Sedgwick County declared an emergency. More than 10 counties in Kansas have issued their own declaration of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

With the declaration, the board also unanimously passed closing all county owned and operated buildings to the public, with the exception by appointment.

The declaration is from Monday, March 23 through Friday, April 3. The two weeks according to the board will give the county time to assess the needs of those within the county and determine what are the next steps needed to move forward.

""There will be employees that we have to address that have compromised health,"" County Administrator Will Johnson said. ""We'll have employees that are truly fearful. We have to have compassion for them.""

With the declaration, the county also moved to limit events with 50 or more people. There are certain restrictions according to the board that apply to the detention center as well.

""I’m looking for evidence of 50 people or less in the detention facilities,"" board member Jeff Masterson said. ""That function will have to continue.""

For county employees, they are eliminating all out-of-state and out-of-county, with the exception of Sedgwick County travel has been canceled.

""We’re going to keep everyone home right now,"" Johnson said.

All future board meetings will be held without the general public in attendance. To comply with the Kansas Open Meetings Act, all meetings will be streamed via the county website.

""They don’t have to participate in the meetings,"" Johnson said. ""As long as they can view, we’re in line with KOMA.""

The discussion of furloughing county employees was approved. However, how those employees will be paid is still being discussed. Johnson stated those who have been furloughed may use vacation or personal time off. However, Woydziak stated the county should pay employees without using their accrued time.

""We’re hoping to be better situated through this,"" Johnson said. ""Only time will tell.""",65803,2020-03-21

Osage County Sheriff’s deputies wait inside the entrance of the county courthouse to check the medical conditions of all visitors and employees.

LYNDON, Kan. – With conditions seemingly changing by the minute, Osage County has joined other counties across Kansas in declaring a public health emergency in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. At a special meeting called March 17, 2020, Osage County commissioners also took action to limit access to the courthouse and conduct a health screening of all who enter, including employees.

Also Tuesday, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced the state’s efforts against the virus will include the closure of the state’s school buildings for the remainder of the school year and ordered that group gatherings across the state be limited to no more than 50 people in a single area.

Osage County’s emergency declaration followed the state’s declaration of March 12, and once enacted it authorizes the activation of the county’s local emergency response plan.

At Tuesday’s special commission meeting, with most of the county department heads in attendance, Osage County Health Department Director Jackie Patterson, who is also the county’s health officer, outlined then current statistics on coronavirus cases in the U.S. By March 18 the total had risen to 7,038 total cases in the U.S. with 97 deaths; and in Kansas, 21 positive test results and one death.

Patterson reported Tuesday there was one person under investigation from Osage County.

“This is a person who has been identified as someone who qualifies to be tested,” Patterson told the commissioners. “As of this morning, we still don’t have the results back.”

She explained that although testing for the virus was now underway in the U.S., it could take several days to get results back.

Patterson said the Osage County resident and her family are under a 14-day quarantine. She said the reason the person was tested was because they had traveled.

“We don’t have any local spread yet,” Patterson said, noting no known positive cases in Osage County at that time.

Commissioners considered the feasibility of closing the courthouse temporarily or limiting access, and all nodded in agreement with Patterson that the courthouse should stay open for public business as long as it was possible.

“We still have to run our county and we still have people that need services, and we still have people that need things,” Patterson said.

After discussion about how to limit access, commissioners decided entry to the courthouse would only be through the west entrance and it would be monitored by a sheriff’s deputy.

“They would possibly do a quick health screen like take your temperature and just make sure we don’t have somebody coming in that’s noticeably sick,” Patterson said. “Might ask them a couple of questions, have you been to – have a specific list of places that might be hot beds right now.”

Osage County Commissioner Ken Kuykendall asked Sheriff Laurie Dunn if she had officers available to man the courthouse door.

“I will,” Dunn said. “We will get it done, if that’s what we’re going to do.”

“I thought it was a good idea last week,” Dunn said. “I shut my buildings down last week, just for those purposes, the number of people coming into my buildings, I have small lobbies.”

Buildings under Dunn’s responsibility include the jail and sheriff’s office. She later told Osage County News that the front door of the sheriff’s office is now locked and any visitors will need to ring a doorbell and wait for an officer to let them in.

“There comes a point when I have to protect my employees,” Dunn said.

Regarding the courthouse screening, Dunn said, “Everybody is going to have to go through it. Every time you go smoke, you’re going to have to take the long trip, and I know that upsets courthouse employees.”

By Tuesday afternoon, commissioners had implemented the screening process for courthouse visitors, with two deputies stationed a few feet inside the west courthouse door armed with an oral and forehead thermometer and a jug of hand sanitizer.

Kuykendall also questioned Patterson about guidelines for local restaurants and churches.

Patterson said she was recommending everyone follow the national guideline of congregating in groups of less than 10 people.

Concerning restaurants, “Right now we’re not going to close them down,” Patterson said. “Most of our restaurants are pretty small. Most of times they don’t have 10 people except during rush hour. Most times they don’t have 10 people within close proximity with each other.

“As long as we can prevent any of that (groups of more than 10), I will let them monitor themselves,” she said.

“Right now we don’t have a positive case, as soon as we do that, we will reevaluate,” Patterson said.

She offered the same recommendation for churches – meet in groups less than 10 people only.

Patterson said she expected her office to be hectic soon and asked if Osage County Clerk Rhonda Beets could assist her as a public information officer during the health emergency. Beets agreed and the two noted they would be setting up a Facebook page to provide pandemic information that pertains to Osage County.

Later Tuesday, Beets issued a press release that outlined the public health emergency and said the county health department would be monitoring the COVID-19 outbreak and is working with Kansas Department of Health and Environment and other Osage County agencies to manage the situation.

The release also offered these recommendations to all Osage County residents:

All people over the age of 60 and those with underlying health concerns should take all precautions to self-protect. Consider avoiding social gatherings. If you have a fever, cough, shortness of breath or other medical issues that can be addressed over the phone, contact your healthcare provider before going to the office or emergency room.

Inside events that have over 10 attendees should be cancelled.

Take these common steps to avoid contracting COVID-19, Influenza A and B, and the seasonal cold.

Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Avoid touching your face and cover your face when coughing or sneezing.

Refrain from personal contact with other people.

Socially distance yourself from large gatherings of people.

Utilize disinfectant products on common surfaces if you have to be out (such as a grocery cart).

Utilize hand sanitizers when hand washing is unavailable.

Wednesday morning, county commissioners agreed to hold special meetings at 8:30 a.m. daily Monday to Saturday, until further notice.

NKyTribune staff

Boone, Kenton, Campbell and Grant counties declared states of emergency Friday, to further prepare and respond to COVID-19.

The four judges/executive declared the States of Emergency in order to activate the individual County Emergency Operations Plans and to encourage cooperation between all levels of government and public health officials to ensure a proactive and coordinated response to the coronavirus.

There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Northern Kentucky at this time, but this action enables the Emergency Management Team to have additional resources at their disposal.

“Boone County has been closely monitoring the current situation and now is the appropriate time to act. We will continue to coordinate our efforts and assist in the multidisciplinary and regional response to the coronavirus,” Judge/Executive Gary Moore said. “Boone County residents should remain calm and be confident that County government will be doing everything within its power to keep the community safe and prepared. I urge everyone to continue to take appropriate steps to protect their own health in accordance with Northern Kentucky Health Department and CDC guidelines. The entire County organization and the Health Department have my full support and confidence.”

The four counties comprise the Northern Kentucky Health Department, which provides public health services to their more than 400,000 residents.

“We are in full support of the decision of our elected officials to declare states of emergency. Declaring states of emergency opens our area to additional resources to support efforts to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 in our region,” stated NKY Health’s District Director of Health, Lynne Saddler, MD, MPH.

NKY Health continues to work with partners to prepare and plan for the spread of COVID-19 in the community. This includes education and guidance to the general public and health care providers, as well as other sectors, including schools, first responders, social service agencies, homeless shelters and organizations that serve those at high risk of becoming very sick from COVID-19.

Kenton County Judge/Executive Kris Knochelmann called on the communities of Northern Kentucky to come together as the region’s health and government leaders have.

“Kenton County has been working with our local partners in response to COVID-19 in order to best protect our community” said Judge/Execurtive Knochelmann. “Residents are encouraged to check the County’s website regularly for local and state updates from the Health Department and the office of the Governor. Please keep your family and neighbors in mind going forward, and we will emerge stronger as a community on the other side of this event.”

The proclamations allow emergency services to activate internal processes for local and inter-jurisdictional disaster emergency planning and purchasing.

This does not mean that schools, business, churches and other like organizations have to close. It is at the discretion of each entity to make the decision whether or not to remain in operation.

Community members are encouraged to follow the Northern Kentucky Health Department (NKYHD) guidelines to protect against COVID-19 including:

*Wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

*Stay home when you feel sick.

*Get the flu vaccine.

*Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose with unwashed hands.

*Properly cover your sneeze and cough with a tissue, then throw away the used tissue.

Despite the lack of any identified cases of COVID-19 in Northern Kentucky, the situation continues to evolve.

“While there will likely be cases of COVID-19 in Campbell County, the declaration does not mean we think our community is less safe than anywhere else impacted by the virus,” said William R. Turner the Director of the County’s Office of Emergency Management. “This is just one more tool to aid in our response.”

State of Emergency Declarations are a typical response to COVID-19, and municipalities across the country are using them to ensure appropriate resources are available for response and recovery.

In consultation with local health department officials, the counties’ leaders are confident the people of Northern Kentucky remain at low risk and citizens are encouraged to visit the Northern Kentucky Health Department website for more information.

"171","Kentucky","Grayson","https://gcnewsgazette.com/Content/Default/Local-News-Stories/Article/State-of-emergency-declared-in-Grayson/-3/9/2181","State of emergency declared in Grayson","Following a press conference involving multiple local officials on Tuesday morning, Grayson County Judge Executive Kevin Henderson signed an order declaring a state of emergency in Grayson County in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

At press time Friday, at least one person had been tested in Grayson County for COVID-19, but there have been no positive cases of the virus locally.

The first to speak during Tuesday's press conference, following Henderson's introductions, was Twin Lakes Regional Medical Center CEO Wayne Meriwether, who said hospital staff have referred to this period as the ""calm before the storm.""

While information is changing by the hour, Meriwether said TLRMC is prepared.

""We have our plan in place to address COVID-19,"" he said.

TLRMC this week implemented strict visitor restrictions, as well as the cancellation of all locally performed elective procedures (those that are planned and will not endanger a patient's life should they be cancelled).

While Grayson County has not yet had a patient diagnosed with COVID-19, hospital officials expect that it will before the pandemic has subsided, Meriwether said.

An individual who is diagnosed with COVID-19 is recommended to be off from work for 14 days, officials say.

Currently, the hospital's patient capacity is manageable, despite receiving about 60 percent of its supplies due to limited availability, but local health care officials say precautions put in place by the federal, state, and local governments are warranted to stave off the spread of COVID-19.

Dr. Joe Lee, of Leitchfield Pediatrics, said social distancing, including the closure of schools and businesses such as restaurants (with the exception of carry-out or drive-thru), is a vital, if inconvenient, part of this endeavor.

""In addition to social distancing, you want to make sure you're washing your hands more than you've ever done it,"" Lee said, adding that people should also cover their cough - not with their hands, but with their elbow or a tissue.

It is also important to frequently wipe off surfaces hands may touch, according to Lee.

The issue at hand, Lee said, is that officials do not know how many people have COVID-19 and may not be aware of it or show symptoms, but by implementing social distancing early, it can prevent the virus from spreading before it infects a greater number of people than providers may be equipped to deal with.

Lee was followed by Grayson County Public Health Director Josh Embry who asked the community to be patient with health care providers while they work to secure testing materials.

Embry echoed Lee's sentiments by saying that, while he understands social distancing is an inconvenience, it not only protects citizens from potential exposure to the coronavirus, it also allows health care officials more time to prepare to respond to it.

Grayson County Schools Superintendent Doug Robinson then addressed the recent school closure, which is, tentatively, in effect until April 13, but could potentially last longer.

On Monday, Grayson County Schools served 441 lunches to students through its Meals on the Bus program, and that number is expected to increase daily, with new stops being added as the weeks go on.

""Some mobile food routes will be flexible depending on need,"" Robinson said.

Anyone with questions is encouraged to call the Grayson County Board of Education or their child's school at one of the numbers listed below.

Henderson then addressed the community directly, encouraging residents to help one another and make use of the resources available to them if they require assistance.

""We're all in this together,"" Henderson said, adding that officials want to be ""proactive and not reactive"" to the situation.

He asked that residents follow the guidelines set by the state and federal governments and to reach out to their friends and neighbors and help them if needed.

""If we all come together and try to make the best decisions, we'll be okay,"" Henderson said.

He also asked residents to be patient with retailers and their employees, ensuring that they will not stop delivering items, and to be mindful of one another and not hoard items.

Henderson encouraged residents to remember local businesses during this time of economic strife and continue to support them by shopping locally.

And finally, he said residents should not panic.

""The extraordinary measures that Gov. Hogan announced today may come as a shock to some county residents but I fully support his decisions,"" said Pittman in a statement.

Pittman also directed the office of personnel to create a new telework policy to allow flexibility for most county workers to perform their duties remotely during this crisis. The new guidance is expected to be implemented March 16 to align with the two-week closure of all state schools announced Thursday by State Superintendent Karen Salmon.



The Anne Arundel Department of Health also issued new guidance on public events designed to protect residents and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The guidance is intended for private and local organizations and community partners in Anne Arundel County and the City of Annapolis.



""Each of us is responsible to take actions that will slow the spread of the COVID-19 disease,"" said Kalyanaraman.

Postpone or cancel all public gathering of more than 250 people per the governor's order on March 12

Postpone or cancel public gatherings that meet anyof the following criteria:

The declaration at the local level follows the state of Maryland, after the governor declared a state of emergency March 5.

Glassman's state of emergency allows Harford County to draw upon state and federal resources to support the county as it responds to what he called ""an immediate and serious threat to public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Harford County.""

Three people have tested positive for the new coronavirus in Harford County as of Wednesday morning, according to the Maryland Department of Health. That is an increase of one since Tuesday. State health officials say 85 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in Maryland as of Wednesday morning, an increase from Tuesday's total, which was 57.

All 28 people who tested positive for the virus between Tuesday and Wednesday were under age 65, according to state health data.

The first case of new coronavirus in Harford County was reported March 9. One week after returning from overseas, officials said an 86-year-old woman who had traveled through Turkey was hospitalized after she became ill.

One of her family members, who is 69 years old, also tested positive, officials reported March 14, stating that person was isolated at home with no symptoms.

There was no information immediately available about the third case, reported March 18.

At the Harford County Council meeting Tuesday night, which was closed to the public but livestreamed to protect the health of the community, Harford County Health Officer Russell Moy said Maryland was experiencing community transmission.

""What that means is basically it's in the community now,"" Moy said of the new coronavirus. ""You can now just get it from anywhere.""

This is breaking news and will be updated.

Charlie Baker explains why he declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus outbreak.

Berkshire County COVID-19 Cases at 7; Governor Declares State of Emergency

NORTH ADAMS, Mass. — Gov. Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency on Tuesday afternoon as the state continued to grapple with rising numbers of presumptive positives for the novel coronavirus.

The governor, at a press conference broadcast from Boston, said the Executive Branch would begin instituting measures to address the spread of the disease, including prohibiting international travel on behalf of the state for its 42,000 employees, encouraging the use of telecommunicating and video conferencing where viable, canceling large events and asking workers who are sick or who exposed to the virus to remain home.

The total number of presumptive positives for COVID-19 in the state rose to 92 — double the number on Monday — with seven of those in Berkshire County.

One of the two new cases reported in Berkshire County is an employee of General Dynamics.

The defense company in Pittsfield learned on Monday afternoon that one of its employee had been quarantined and was being treated at a medical facility. Staff who had been in contact with the employee have been asked to ""self-quarantine"" for two weeks.

Also, North Adams City Councilor Jason LaForest, who is also a nurse, has entered quarantine after being tested for exposure to the novel coronavirus. According to a statement from Mayor Thomas Bernard, LaForest developed ""mild symptoms"" on Tuesday morning and that the mayor has also elected to work from home after attending ""weekend social functions with Councilor LaForest.""

The first patient in Berkshire County was identified on Saturday after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control lifted some of the restrictions on testing. The first presumptive positive case in the state was a woman in Norfolk County on March 2.

""MEMA has been activated and is bringing together health, human service, public safety and several other government agencies,"" said the governor. ""This working group is following the Department of Public Health infectious disease task force that was stood up in January. ... this declaration will give our administration more flexibility to respond to this outbreak.""

He said the risks for transmission have increased, noting the Berkshire cases ""that just popped.""

Sudders said the presumptive positive is based on testing from the state Public Health Lab. ""Those specimens will now be sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention for confirmation,"" she said.

Of the 92 reported cases, 70 are related to a Biogen conference held in Boston at the end of February and four are travel related. Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders said 18 are under investigation. Six people are hospitalized, 62 are not and 24 are under investigation; 40 are women and 52 are men.

Another man from nearby Readsboro, Vt., was hospitalized on Thursday at Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington.

COVID-19 first spread in the vicinity of Wuhan, China, where it has so far killed more than 3,000 deaths out of more than 80,000 cases. There are now more than 800 cases identified in the United States and 28 deaths — most of those in the state of Washington.

The symptoms include fever, severe cough and respiratory distress. At least 80 percent of those contracting the disease will recover with the severity of the illness ranging from hospitalization to minor or no symptoms. Those most at risk are individuals age 60 and older or who have underlying medical conditions.

Officials said the coronavirus is apparently spreading through person-to-person contact now, beyond any direct correlations to travel or the conference.

Because the outbreak is ""rapidly expanding"" through community transmission, said Commissioner of Public Health Dr. Monica Bharel, ""we are at a critical point in this outbreak ... we will need everybody's cooperation.""

The governor applauded the decision by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh on Tuesday to cancel the St. Patrick's Day Parade but said it's too early yet to consider the Boston Marathon that is a month away. He said private enterprises should consider how they will address situations such as sporting events, conferences and large gatherings.

Local organizations are making decisions on how to prevent the spread of the disease. The town of Clarksburg shut down its public buildings on Sunday to allow them to be cleaned and sanitized after it was learned the first Berkshire County came from that town.

General Dynamics has instituted measures including cleaning and disinfecting work areas and common spaces used by the affected employees, ""who was in the facility for several days out of the last two weeks,"" according to a statement from the company.

""The Pittsfield facility remains open for business. We are working closely with officials from Berkshire County to keep them apprised of our proactive measures. The health and safety of our employees, our Navy partners, and our community is our top priority,"" said Carlo Zaffanella, vice president and general manager of Maritime and Strategic Systems for General Dynamics Mission Systems.

The Berkshire Food Project, which feeds dozens of people lunch every week day in North Adams, posted on Facebook that it would be ""sanitizing tables a lot"" and rearranging them to reduce the number of people sitting together in close proximity.

""We are trying to be overly cautious because we care about everyone who dines with us,"" the post states, adding that ""we will be happy to provide your meal to go if you are concerned about congregating in our dining room for a meal.""

The North Adams Public Schools and McCann Technical School were disinfected by fogging devices over the weekend. Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art ""is actively following CDC recommendations,"" according to its website , which includes ""cleaning of touch surfaces, deployment of more hand-disinfectant stations, and encouragement of frequent hand washing, and hygienic 'sneeze and cough' etiquette.""

The vast museum may be large enough to allow browsing while still keeping the recommended social distancing of 6 feet to prevent transmission.

Bharel said the highly contagious virus can be spread through surfaces, personal contact and through droplets from coughing and sneezing.",NA,NA

Bay County Executive Jim Barcia on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 17, announced the declaration of a local state of emergency for the county. He made the declaration during the Bay County Board of Commissioners meeting held within the gymnasium of the Bay County Community Center at 800 John F. Kennedy Drive in Bay City.

The declaration comes a few days after the county’s first presumptive positive test for a case of coronavirus, that man being a Bay County resident and physician at Covenant HealthCare in Saginaw.

Such a declaration lasts seven days, but the board voted to extend it until its next meeting on April 14.

“We know there are more,” Barcia said. “Additional people have been tested. We don’t know what the results of those tests are. This will make Bay County eligible for all the resources made available to our municipal government from federal and state governments in Lansing and Washington. All this does is declare what we have — a state of emergency.”

Barcia said it typically takes eight days for results to come in on the coronavirus tests.

“We are concerned for everyone’s health and safety during this coronavirus disease pandemic,” Barcia continued. “Much has changed in just a short period of time. We are going to be taking all necessary steps to help stop the spread of this disease in our community while continuing to provide the services that are needed.”

He added that as of Tuesday morning, offices within the Bay County Building are closed to the public.

“However, services will still be provided to the public as our workers will still be reporting,” Barcia said.

Bay County Health Department Director Joel R. Strasz said his agency’s staff have been working with peers in Saginaw and Midland counties as well as with personnel at Covenant HealthCare.

“We have contacted nearly two dozen individuals associated with this case,” said Strasz, referring to the presumptive positive Bay County case. “In some cases, some individuals have self-quarantined for the 14-day process.”

He added about 30 people have been tested, those tests having been submitted to state and private labs.

“At least seven have come back negative and we’re waiting to hear on the remaining tests,” Strasz said. An estimated 15 people have been admitted to inpatient hospitals with symptoms similar to those of coronavirus, he continued.

The state can process about 150 tests per day and that is being ramped up, Strasz said.

Both Barcia and Strasz said that as Bay County has the highest percentage of residents 60 or older, it is imperative for all citizens to do their part in flattening the curve, or stymieing the contagion’s spread.

“We must protect all Bay County residents, but especially the most vulnerable,” Strasz said.

As of Tuesday, there are 65 people in Michigan who have tested presumptive positive for coronavirus, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

PREVENTION TIPS

Michigan’s State Emergency Operations Center is coordinating state-government resources and the response to the coronavirus spread. It has shared the following tips:

What you can do to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases:

· Always cover coughs or sneezes with a tissue or sleeve.

· Stay home if you are sick and advise others to do the same.

· Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

· Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

· Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

· Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and warm water are not available.

· Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (computers, keyboards, desks, etc.).

· It’s not too late to get your flu shot! While the influenza vaccine does not protect against COVID-19 infection, it can help keep you healthy during the flu season.

It’s the first time in the city’s history such an emergency declaration has been made, Jackson spokesman Aaron Dimick said.

The announcement was made the morning of Tuesday, March 17, shortly before Jackson County announced its first positive test for the disease caused by the new coronavirus.

""It is a precautionary measure,"" Dimick said. ""If this is something that spreads through Jackson County over the next couple weeks, this could be a huge drain on our city services.""

As mayor, Dobies can unilaterally call a state of emergency, Dimick said. City officials worked with Jackson County Emergency Management officials before making the announcement.

The state of emergency doesn’t trigger many tangible changes, but does show the community that the city is dedicating resources to the issue, Dimick said. It also makes it easier for the city to receive state or federal aid to address the situation.

City workers are setting up hand-washing and hand-sanitizing stations around Jackson on Tuesday afternoon as a measure to fight the spread of the virus. The city is renting portable stations from Lester Brothers and setting them up at the following 10 locations:

Blackman Park at CP Federal City Square, 212 W. Michigan Ave. (hand-washing)

Boos Center at the parking lot near Edgewood Street, 210 Gilbert St. (hand-washing)

City Hall front lobby, 161 W. Michigan Ave. (sanitizing stand)

New Leaf Park near the walking trail, 2012 Fourth St. (sanitizing stand)

Elnora Moorman Park near the walking trail, East High Street and Milwaukee Street (sanitizing stand)

Reed Manor, 301 Steward Ave. (hand-washing)

Second Missionary Baptist Church fellowship hall, 304 E. Prospect St. (sanitizing stand)

Downtown Jackson bus station, 127 W. Cortland St. (hand-washing)

A hand-sanitizing station has been set up at Jackson City Hall, 161 W. Michigan Ave.

The city also canceled its City Council meeting scheduled for March 17, as well as all other upcoming meetings. Officials are looking into ways to host the meetings remotely so people can watch and still participate in public comment – perhaps by calling in, Dimick said.

Any special meetings will be announced with a few days notice, he said.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has banned gatherings of more than 250 people, ordered all K-12 schools shut down and barred restaurants from offering dine-in service as measures to fight the spread of the disease. Health officials urge residents to stay home as much as possible and practice social distancing.

There are currently no confirmed cases in Upper Michigan, but officials say this is a precautionary move to prepare for if and when the county has to deal with COVID-19.

This declaration allows Marquette County to go to the state and request resources, which could include equipment and supplies.

The Marquette County Board also unanimously approved another measure during the meeting to help employees who are being impacted by the statewide mandatory school closures.

“The board approved for the next month, the use of medical leave for employees that have to stay home and take care of youngsters during the next 30 days,” said Gerry Corkin, Marquette County Chairman. “The board thought it was the right thing to do.”

County of Marquette employees may also utilize the paid medical leave if they must provide care for a child in quarantine, or if the employee themselves is required to be in quarantine.

Monroe Mayor Robert Clark issued a ""State of Emergency"" Sunday for the city in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

This is in addition to, and goes beyond, the notice he issued earlier closing all city-owned offices and buildings to the public at mid-day Friday. Sunday's notice sets into place formal procedures to work with regional and state officials on a response plan.

Monroe County's first coronavirus case was confirmed late Saturday by state and Monroe County health officials.

City of Monroe was the first local government entity in Monroe County to take either an office closing or a State of Emergency issuance to the situation. Clark plans to address area residents during the regularly scheduled Monroe City Council meeting tonight, which is 7:30 p.m. The meeting will be shown live on the City’s YouTube channel and also on the government channel, 18/Comcast or 190/Charter.

The notice is as follows:

Over the past several weeks, City Council and Administration has been continuously reviewing the City's response plan in relation to the Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, including those measures announced in the past few days. It has become overwhelmingly obvious that our preparations and response will require a more formal incident command structure to direct the City resources necessary to protect the health and safety of our residents.

As such, on Sunday, March 15, at 6:00PM, Mayor Robert E. Clark signed a declaration of a State of Emergency in the City of Monroe. This declaration triggers the City’s internal organizational response as outlined and authorized in Chapter 52 of the City Code by creating the Office of Emergency Preparedness, activating the Emergency Operations Center, and the appointment of an Emergency Preparedness Coordinator to monitor developments and oversee the distribution of city resources as needed.

The Declaration of Emergency reads as such:

“Therefore, I hereby declare a State of Emergency exists in the City of Monroe and direct the following:

Activation of the City's Emergency Operations Plan and the establishment of the Office of Emergency Preparedness.

I ask the City Council to appoint City Manager Vince Pastue as the Emergency Preparedness Coordinator. The Coordinator shall coordinate the activities of the agencies, departments and individuals within the City to protect the public health, safety and welfare during this emergency.

The Coordinator shall designate an Emergency Management Liaison to work with Monroe County Emergency Management on all matters pertaining to emergency management within the City of Monroe.

The Coordinator shall designate officers from City departments having responsibilities for emergency management.”

The full resolution of this action can be found on our web site.

Mayor Clark: “Administration, with the support of City Council, has been working diligently over the past several days to prepare for the inevitable moment the Coronavirus outbreak reaches our community. With the confirmation of the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in Monroe County announced last evening, I am issuing this Declaration of Emergency to aid the City in battling this highly infectious disease. This will create a more nimble and flexible government that is capable of meeting the challenges our community may face as this pandemic evolves. These decisions are not taken lightly, and are made with the health and welfare of all members of our community as a top priority and responsibility.”

City of Monroe administration has been working closely with the Monroe County Health Department (MCHD) and Monroe County Emergency Management Division (MCEMD) during this pandemic. Both the MCHD and the MCEMD are currently operating under the emergency declaration of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, as commenced on March 10, 2020.

Residents are encouraged to watch the City Council meeting tomorrow, Monday, March 16, at 7:30 PM for further information, including an additional statement from Mayor Clark. Council meetings are streamed live on the City’s YouTube channel and also on the government channel, 18/Comcast or 190/Charter.

The public should regularly monitor the City’s website (www.monroemi.gov), Facebook page, app push notifications, the city’s government channel: channel (18/Comcast or 190/Charter), and local media for updates.

City administration will continue to evaluate how to reallocate staff and resources in the most efficient way possible and monitor the situation as it may pertain to the operations of public facilities. Any changes in addition to those released in recent days will be announced via the communication methods highlighted above.

As a reminder, everyone should be taking the following precautions to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including, but not limited to:

If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19, call your health care provider. If you do not have a health care provider, call the nearest hospital. Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If not available, use hand sanitizer. Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or upper sleeve when coughing or sneezing. Avoid contact with people who are sick. If you are sick, stay home, and avoid contact with others. Replace handshakes with elbow bumps. Stay at least 6 feet away from others when in a public setting (social distancing).

Information around this outbreak is changing rapidly. The latest information is available at Michigan.gov/Coronavirus and CDC.gov/Coronavirus.

Carr of Lakeview this afternoon signed a local state of emergency declaration, following Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s state of emergency declaration on March 10 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

County residents should not panic at the phrase “local state of emergency” — it just means the county’s emergency operations plan has officially been activated, county officials are working to slow the spread of COVID-19, and the county may be eligible for state funding if all county resources are exhausted. Montcalm County currently has one documented case of COVID-19 and that resident has been recovering at home.

County boards, city commissions, township boards and village councils may continue to have public meetings at their discretion at this time.

In the meantime, Montcalm County government offices remain open, albeit with a few reduced and/or revamped services.

“It’s fluid and evolving very fast,” Carr said. “As of right now, it’s our intention to stay open. We’d like to try to remain open, there’s a critical element with each office, they are all essential services and they’d be hard to close completely We are trying to remain open and still try to exercise precautions to keep our employees and residents safe and healthy.”

Paul R. Geyer, Schoolcraft County emergency management coordinator, will provide liaison and coordination with state and federal authorities for assistance related to this incident, the release states, and in accordance with Section 14 of PA 390 of 1976, as amended, has been directed to transmit the request to the Michigan State Police and the MSP Emergency Management and Homeland Security Department.",8247,2020-03-19

This allows us to fully utilize resources made available by the state and federal government while also layering on local resources to help provide services to anyone who may need them.”

The declaration made on a motion by Commissioner Scott Windschitl, seconded by Commissioner Tony Berg, must be made for Brown County to be able to apply for possible state and federal assistance for COVID-19 costs. All county departments must track costs for possible reimbursement.

Commissioners also:

• Received an informational update on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) and the role of the public health department in planning and response.

“Because this is a new virus, there are still things we do not know, such as how severe the illness can be, how well it is transmitted between people, and other features of it. We are learning more about it as it evolves. The situation is evolving daily. Information we have today may not be the information we have tomorrow,” read the Brown County Public Health request.

“We are in full emergency operations and incident command mode,” said Brown County Public Health Director Karen Moritz. “It takes all five of us to handle phone calls.”

Moritz said as of Monday, there were 54 Minnesota cases, 4,661 cases and 85 deaths in the United States, 185,067 global cases and 7,330 deaths.

She described disease symptoms as fever, cough and shortness of breath.

“Stay home if you’re sick, cover coughs, wash hands well and avoid face touching,” Moritz said. She urged people to make virtual contact, answering screening questions with their medical facility (Allinahealth.org) to determine if testing is needed before calling or going to see a doctor.

“You don’t have to test just because you are sick. Eighty percent of cases are mild,” Moritz said. “Prepare for the worst. Hope for the best. Keep calm. Wash your hands often. We are resilient and will work through this. Be kind to each other. Check on the elderly.”

The Minnesota Department of Public Health hotline is 651-201-3920.

Commissioners also:

• Unanimously approved a design engineer proposal to rehabilitate Bridge 6534 on State Highway 13 over the Little Cottonwood River, motion by Windschitl, seconded by Berg. The bridge was built in 1953, widened in 1977 and is in satisfactory condition.

It does not have concrete approach panels. It has twist-down guard rail that is not recommended anymore. This segment of State Highway 13 is planned for concrete overlay in 2021.

The State Aid Bridge Office was contacted to see if the bridge needs any special treatment with a concrete overlay on the approach. The office determined concrete approach panels should be added to each end of the bridge to protect it from concrete overlay.

The office suggested that end blocks be inspected and possibly repaired since the design has had end blocks fail. Brown County has two bridges where concrete end blocks failed and had to be repaired.

A consultant is required to design approach panels and end block repair if needed plus design the guard rail to current standards. Erickson Engineering made a proposal to inspect the bridge for a $1,100 estimated fee. Cost of the bridge rehabilitation design and plans was estimated at $20,600.

• Appointed New Ulm Assistant City Engineer Joe Stadtheim as the Brown County Planning Commission District 1 Commissioner, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Windschitl.

• Unanimously approved a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) application by Brad Gaard, Section 4, Sigel Township to continue to allow operation of a manufacturing and machine shop including a lathe and milling machine as a home occupation in an accessory structure, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Veerkamp.

• A CUP application by Arland Roiger, Section 33, North Star Township and Section 5, Stately Township to allow use of an existing gravel mine to include crushing and/or screening, gravel extraction and processing, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Borchert.

Commissioners received a letter dated March 15 from Gary and Pat Roiger complaining about gravel hauling dust on weekends and questioned the need to haul gravel on weekends.

• A CUP application by Matthew J. Dorfner of MICB Inc., on property owned by Loren J. and Yvonne Gage, Section 9, Cottonwood Township, to allow use of an existing 110-foot radio transmission tower for a Christian-related radio station, motion by Commissioner Veerkamp, seconded by Commissioner Berg.

• A CUP application by Andrew Schmidt, Section 19, Burnstown Township, to continue to allow use of a 40 foot by 85 foot office building to include an employee equipment storage shop for a masonry business, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Veerkamp.

• Preliminary plat applications filed by Bruce Pace, 6.32 acres, Section 26, Linden Township, to adjust the current building site, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Windschitl; filed by Charles Waibel, Section 33, Sigel Township, to separate the building site from tillable acres, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Simonsen.

• By a 3-2 vote with Commissioners Simonsen and Berg dissenting, refused a request to move the Brown County Probation Juvenile Crew Leader position to full-time status and reduce the Sentence to Service crewleader positions from two to one.

Commissioner Windschitl made the motion, seconded by Commissioner Veerkamp, to refuse the request. Windschitl said he didn’t see the benefit of making the change and that the initial financial savings would not last.

The request was made due to retirement of the current half-time plus juvenile crew leader and to post a vacancy for a full-time crew leader position. County savings was estimated at $13,584.

• Unanimously approved a recommendation of the Wetlands Ad Hoc Committee of clarifying the April 18, 2017 decision that the Notice of Decision is valid in perpetuity, so long as the applicant’s activity described in the application commences within three years of the decision, motion by Commissioner Simonsen, seconded by Commissioner Berg.

The decision stems from a wetland impact evaluation, irrigation well pumping test, no loss determination regarding a water appropriation permit application by Jason Cunningham, Stark Township.

In a Dec. 20, 2016, letter to Brown County Wetland Administrator John Knisely, Principal Hydrogeologist Daniel Whitney, P.G. of Northwest Aqwatek Solutions, LLC (NWATS), wrote “no impact to the to the wetland will occur from utilizing an irrigation well at a rate of about 450 gallons per minute for crop production during the growing season that supports the assertion of a no-loss determination for the wetland.

The permit involves a wetland adjacent to the Cunningham farm field related to cropland irrigation. The three-acre wetland was classified as a Type 1 Wetland that periodically contains surface water, particularly during early spring, but is often farmed during dry periods.

Due to the proximity of the wetland to the respective irrigation well, Brown County required Cunningham to complete a Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act joint application in accordance with Minnesota Rule 8420.0415 (Appendix D).

On Monday, Minnesota confirmed 19 new cases of the novel coronavirus, for a statewide total of 54.

By declaring a local state of emergency, Cook County’s emergency management department can request funding from, and work in cooperation with other agencies, including from the state and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The Kandiyohi County Board of Commissioners approved the declaration at an emergency meeting Thursday. As part of the state of emergency, the commissioners approved closing the county Health and Human Services Building and also the County Office Building in downtown Willmar to the general public starting Friday.

""The County Board has the authority to close buildings, limit access and reduce hours,"" said County Administrator Larry Kleindl.

The declaration will remain in effect until at least April 13, when the county's medical emergency team will re-evaluate the situation.

This order does not impact the county courthouse, the Law Enforcement Center or the child care center located on the bottom floor of the Health and Human Services building. That being said, Kandiyohi County Sheriff Eric Holien said after the meeting that the LEC is also restricting access and people should call before coming down.

While the buildings might be closed to the public for the most part, business continues for the county.

""Our employees will still be reporting,"" Kleindl said.

The plan is for staff to do as much as it can through the phone or online. Customers who need to drop off forms or payments will be able to use drop boxes at both locations.

For those that must meet with a county employee, they should call the correct department and set up an interview. When they arrive at the building, the employee meeting with the individual will come downstairs to let the person in the building.

Social distancing will be practiced, which includes trying to leave at least 6 feet between people. The county is hoping for state and federal waivers regarding some of its services, so the meetings between client and county could be done remotely.

""We are trying to make this as flexible as possible,"" Kleindl said.

If anyone has any questions they are asked to call. A list of phone numbers for county departments can be found on the county's website at kcmn.us.

""We know this a difficult time, this is the first time for all of us,"" Kleindl said. ""We want to work with you the best we can. We know this will be a challenge for some of us. We're going to do whatever we can to make this work.""

Kleindl thanked the county staff members for all of their work and sacrifices during this uncertain time and doing what they can to keep the public safe while still providing county services.

""Our staff is doing a tremendous job,"" Kleindl said. ""I know these are difficult times. We, administration and the board, are asking a lot of you.""

The county commissioners are also urging members of the public to do what they can to make these situations easier. Commissioner Harlan Madsen asked everyone to get their information from reputable sources and not from a Facebook post. And he also wants people to keep their mental health in mind.

In a statement to the West Central Tribune following the meeting, Commissioner Steve Ahmann urged people to stay optimistic and not give into hate.

""Our country has overcome in the past and we can overcome together. Fear is a powerful motivator and I encourage everyone to cast out fear and negative speculation. Negative thoughts and blaming others can turn into hate,"" Ahmann said. ""Our country does not need fear and hate to contaminate us now. Stay positive and be optimistic.""",42410,NA

Their unanimous vote now sets into motion documentation by county staff as it relates to the response to the virus.

As of Wednesday morning, there were no reported cases of COVID-19 in Nobles County, but numbers of cases continue to rise in the state and around the country.

Nobles County Administrator Tom Johnson explained that the documentation is necessary if costs related to emergency response would ever be reimbursed by the state or federal government. This could include the purchase of medical equipment without prior authorization and without going through the bid process, it was explained.

Board Chairman Justin Ahlers signed a temporary declaration late Tuesday afternoon, as plans were taking shape to close county office buildings to the public.

On Wednesday, the board took official action to close county buildings to the public. The buildings include the Nobles County Government Center in downtown Worthington, the Nobles County and Adrian branch libraries and the Nobles County Public Works facility.

“All employees are to report to work at this time,” Ahlers said, noting that a relaxed dress code is in place as employees will use the time to clean up areas within their offices and buildings.

Access to county services is available to the public via phone or email. Information and links to all departments may be found at co.nobles.mn.us.

The courts, county attorney’s office and Rock-Nobles Community Corrections departments remain open inside the Prairie Justice Center, as required by the Minnesota Supreme Court.

Nobles County Attorney Joe Sanow said the courts will remain open for high priority and super high priority cases, including most felonies.

“It’s mostly business as usual until the Supreme Court says otherwise,” Sanow told commissioners Wednesday.

While there was some discussion about library services, commissioners decided it would be safest to suspend operations at this time and until further notice. The libraries have drop boxes in place for people to return items, but because of the way the virus spreads, they did not want people to be able to check out library items or access the library computers.

Commissioner Matt Widboom pointed out that the library does provide free internet access through wi-fi, and if people want to sit in their vehicles outside the library to access the internet, they are welcome to do so.

There was also discussion about the Ninth Street entrance to the Nobles County Government Center, which provides access to Worthington Public Utilities.

Widboom said he wants all entrances to the building closed to the public, and noted WPU employees have access to their offices without using the public entrance. He also noted they have a payment box and the public can pay their utility bill through the box at this time.

“Closed means closed,” Widboom said.

Johnson said there is plenty of work for county employees to do, even though they won’t be working face-to-face with the public.

“The library’s identified some things that have needed to be done for a while,” he added.

In the community services department, Director Stacie Golombiecki said her staff is “doing everything we can to find creative solutions to meet with people.

“We’re doing a lot of phone contact, and our case managers have made lists of our most vulnerable people and we’ll check in that way,” Golombiecki said. Work that requires home visits — including foster care — will be done through phone check-ins, she added.

With the close working quarters in the community services department, Widboom asked if employees there could spread out their work area.

“Use this room (the boardroom) and any other space you need to spread out, that’s my thought,” Widboom said.

“Generally, everyone can work from a different location in the building,” Golombiecki agreed.

Commissioner Donald Linssen asked if there was a plan in place in the event a county employee contracted the virus, and noted concerns of the virus getting into the government building.

“We’re pulling all the stuff together that has to be done,” Johnson responded. “A formal plan is really challenging because there’s so many unknowns.”

Commissioner Gene Metz asked about employee compensation, should a quarantine be necessary.

“Right now, if an employee doesn’t feel safe here, they are allowed to go home,” responded Human Resources Manager Sue Luing. “They just have to use their benefits — their family leave.”

Tuesday’s Nobles County Board meeting is still planned at this time, though the agenda will only include essential business. That means the public hearing on the proposed half-cent sales tax has been postponed indefinitely. Other agenda items that included reports from outside agencies will also be delayed.

Since the law requires board meetings be open to the public, the plan at this time is to have someone at the front entrance to let people in for the 9 a.m. meeting.

“This is difficult times — especially if you have families and children at home,” said Linssen at the close of Wednesday’s meeting. “There’s a lot of disruption going on.”",21617,NA

This state of emergency builds on state executive orders and federal declarations already imposed.

DULUTH, Minn – As the Coronavirus pandemic continues, the St. Louis County Board of Commissioners has now declared a local state of emergency.

This state of emergency builds on state executive orders and federal declarations already imposed.

Public access to all St. Louis County offices, including walk-up service windows, will now be suspended.

Some St. Louis County employees will also be required to report to work to help allow for the continuation of essential services.

Other staff members are being given the opportunity to complete duties remotely.

“This is going to be more of a marathon than a sprint. It may be a marathon where the finish line is a moving target. There are going to be hurdles,” said St. Louis County Human Resources Director Jim Gottschald.

One of the hurdles the county is overcoming, with this declaration, is the lack of ease to implement disaster plans.

The local state of emergency allows for the flexibility of county leaders to respond and impose necessary resources to react to this pandemic.

“I think we can be responsive to our workforce and residents in a more uncomplicated fashion where we don’t have to look over existing policies and bring the board for a special discussion,” said County Administrator Kevin Gray.

St. Louis county courthouse in Duluth, Hibbing, and Virginia will remain open.

Only high priority cases will be handled.

All other non-essential cases will be rescheduled at a later date.

Also, solid waste sites will continue servicing the county.

The local state of emergency in St. Louis county holds for a period of three days.

At that point, the board of commissioners would have to revisit the resolution, if necessary.

The next board meeting is scheduled for this Tuesday.",200540,2020-03-20

ST. CLOUD — Stearns County is now in a state of emergency, which means many of its public buildings will close to reduce social interactions and mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Stearns County board members held a special meeting Thursday morning and voted unanimously to declare the emergency and delay future board meetings.

The county will close its Administration Building, West Service Center and Melrose Annex to the public. On Thursday, the county's License Centers and Treasurer's Office closed to foot traffic.

Even as they talked about social distancing measures, staff and board members were not all 6 feet apart during the meeting, which was livestreamed online. Board members sat in their usual seats, about an arms-length apart.

Stearns County has between three and five known cases of COVID-19, according to Wednesday figures from the state Department of Health.

For every known case there are between 2.5 and 5 additional cases undiagnosed, Stearns County Public Health Division Director Renee Frauendienst told board members Thursday morning.

She cautioned the number of cases will start to slow down, but it will be a false impression. It's because there aren't enough tests available in the state and not because there's an actual decline in COVID-19 cases.

If you have the symptoms of the coronavirus infection — fever, cough, shortness of breath — you should assume you have it, Frauendienst said.

""We need you to continue doing the social distancing,"" Frauendienst said. ""We know it works.""

Even as the county moves to a state of emergency, most county services will continue.

RELATED: Stearns County coronavirus case confirmed, here's what we know

""We won't close down the county,"" said County Administrator Michael Williams. ""We're not experiencing an extremely high level of expenditure.""

The emergency declaration allows the county to enter into new contracts that help protect people's health and provide emergency aid, according to county documents. And it invokes the county's emergency operations plan.

Staff have gotten creative and will provide services through websites, email, mail, drop boxes, drive-through and by telephone, Williams said. But passports and driver's license services will be on hold.

Employees will work remotely if they can and limit fact-to-face interactions.

Sheriff Steve Soyka and Department of Human Services Administrator Melissa Huberty told board members their offices continue to provide the usual services to the community with precautions to protect staff.

""People are feeling a lot of anxiety,"" said county board member Tarryl Clark. ""It's good for them to know that we're here.""

The board will meet again April 21 and decide whether to extend the emergency.

Alcorn County did the same.

At the height of the storm, 11,000 customers in Alcorn County were without power. That number was down to 1,800 by Monday.

Many trees ares down. Power has been restored to schools but some roads are impassable. Schools in Corinth will reopen Tuesday.

“This has been a devastating ordeal for the city of Corinth,"" Public Works Director Clayton Mills said. ""It’s been a long time since we had a situation like this.”

The damage is widespread, with trees scattered everywhere, power lines down and roads closed.

Corinth city leaders believe straight line winds from a storm Saturday caused most of this damage.

Monday, everyone was thankful no one was seriously hurt.

“You can just look around here and see the potential for loss of life and injury was great,"" said Danny Lowery, who was helping his daughter and her neighbors with cleanup. ""We’re just thankful we didn’t have any.”

Although his daughter is without power and likely won’t have it restored this week, the family is focusing on the positive.

""We’re thankful that we can replace material things and cleanup but it would be hard to replace someone that we lost,” Lowery said.

It’ll be a long cleanup process. City leaders issued a warning.

""People out riding around sightseeing, we would like to ask the public to be more careful, because they could run over or step on a live wire and that would be bad,” Mayor Pro-Tem Mike Hopkins said.

In the wake of Friday's announcement that there are six cases of coronavirus in Mississippi and three are in Forrest County, Hattiesburg mayor Toby Barker and Forrest County Board of Supervisors president David Hogan signed documents declaring the response to COVID-19 a local emergency.

""Declaring COVID-19 as a local emergency is a precaution,"" Hogan said. ""It cuts out the red tape that is often associated with procuring resources, allowing us to serve the residents of Forrest County quickly.""

Barker said the declaration will keep citizens and first responders safer.

""We know that we are in for a long-term approach in responding to COVID-19, and we know we’ll need the resources to do it,"" Barker said. ""The residents of Hattiesburg deserve our best efforts in keeping them healthy and safe.

A steering committee that formed last week met Wednesday and appointed Lincoln County Emergency Management Director Clifford Galey as the spokesman for the group, which includes his office as well as representatives from the City of Brookhaven, Lincoln County Board of Supervisors, Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office, Brookhaven Police Department, Mississippi Highway Patrol, King’s Daughter Medical Center, Brookhaven School District, Lincoln County School District, Brookhaven Academy and Mississippi School of the Arts.

By declaring an emergency, officials can activate a comprehensive emergency plan that was put in place years ago, but recently updated, Galey said.

The declaration allows the city and county to seek state and federal assistance for medical supplies and other needed supplies.

“In general, it gives everyone a little bit more authority than they would normally have if we were not under this COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.

Galey said he is working with all emergency services to fill any unmet needs that may arise due to the statewide outbreak.

No positive cases have been reported in Lincoln County as of Wednesday afternoon, he said.

Galey urged residents to install the free app MS Ready on mobile devices through either the Apple Store or Google Play Store. The app, created for use by the Mississippi State Department of Health, is available in English, Spanish and Vietnamese.

The app provides up-to-date and accurate disaster information including disease outbreaks such as COVID-19.

“If they see it on that site, it is true information,” he said.

Galey said the county’s upcoming Keep Lincoln County Beautiful Spring Cleanup has been postponed until a later date. The drop-off locations in the five districts throughout the month of April will not be available. Galey urged residents who planned to drop off debris and white goods at one of the locations to keep it on their own property until a new date has been determined.

The Brookhaven Recreation Department and all public parks are closed and all city-sponsored recreational activities have been temporarily canceled.

The upcoming Spring Fling and Fair at the Lincoln Civic Center and all civic center and arena activities have been canceled, he said.

He urged residents to stay at home if possible, but if going out, do so responsibly. He said stores and restaurants are making phone, social media and app ordering more user-friendly and offering drive-thru, curbside and delivery service.

“If you don’t need to go out, don’t go out, but if you go out, support the local businesses that are offering safe ways to shop and dine,” he said.

The Lincoln County-Brookhaven Government Complex will remain open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. However, visitors will notice that area are being cleaned and sanitized more often and workers in some offices will be wearing gloves when handling money and interacting with the public.

Those who exhibit any of the symptoms of a coronavirus — fever, dry cough and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing — should not call for an ambulance or go to the KDMC emergency room.

“If for some reason you think you need to be tested, please call your doctor and set it up through your doctor,” he said. “Do not go through the hospital. They will not accept you there.”

He said individuals should call their primary physician and they will advise the person on the proper procedure that needs to be followed.

“Above all, try to stay calm, practice good hand washing and take regular precautions you would take in flu and cold season,” he said. “The health department’s recommendation of hand washing for 20 seconds with soap and warm water is your best option.”",34810,2020-03-20

Chad Bergevin, who lives opposite the center, said he had learned of the situation in a text message from a neighbor. “It was like, ‘Wow, this is literally less than a football field away from my house,’” he said, adding that he was surprised to see people still seeming to come and go near the center. “I’m sorry, if it were me, I’d have the place on lockdown,” he said.

The indications of a possible spread, and the involvement of a nursing home marked a new, urgent phase in the response to the virus in the United States, where 70 cases have been reported, and until Saturday, none had been fatal. Most of the cases could be explained by overseas travel or contact with someone who had been ill. This week, though, new cases, in California, Oregon and Washington, were the first in the United States in which the cause was mysterious and unknown — a sign, experts warned, that the virus, which has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide and has sickened more than 86,000 others, might now be spreading in the United States.

In the Northwest, especially, health officials were putting in place new precautions given the new cases. They were already discussing the possibility that they might recommend cancellations of public events. They began warning that life in the coming weeks may undergo dramatic change.

By Saturday, 10 people have been treated in Washington State, including the first case of coronavirus that was diagnosed in the United States, a man in his 30s who had traveled in China and has since recovered; several patients were treated at a Spokane area hospital after returning from a cruise ship in Japan; and the first known coronavirus fatality in the United States, a man in his 50s whose death was announced Saturday.

In announcing the death at a news conference, President Trump said the victim was a “wonderful woman” in her 50s, but local officials later said the patient had been a man in his 50s. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later said that the patient was, in fact, a man, and that the agency had incorrectly described the patient as a woman.

Few details were known about the man who died, except that he had underlying health conditions and had been a patient at a hospital in Kirkland. He was not known to have traveled abroad, or to have had contact with anyone who had tested positive for the virus, adding to growing signs that the coronavirus may be spreading in the United States. He also had no known connection to the nursing home, officials said.",49688,2020-03-02

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Friday declared a state of emergency in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus and announced the state has two more presumptive positive cases, bringing the total to four.

One of the new cases is a St. Louis County resident in the 50s who case is believed to be related to domestic travel, Parson said in a statement. Details on the other case have not been released yet.

At a news conference, Parson said he considered declaring the state of emergency “the next appropriate step to protect the public health” and stressed the move was not made because of concerns that the state's health care system is overwhelmed or unprepared.

“The primary purpose of this emergency declaration is to provide greater flexibility in allocating our state resources, not because the local health providers feel they are overwhelmed,” Parson told reporters in his Capitol office.

Declaring a state of emergency gives Parson the ability to tap into about $7 million of state disaster funds, which he said can be used for coronavirus response efforts.

Parson also said he did not intend to close the state's schools, as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker did on Friday. Parson said school districts should seek guidance from local health officials in deciding whether to close schools.

However, the University of Missouri System announced in a Friday statement that in-person classes have been suspended for the rest of the spring semester at the system's flagship campus in Columbia and its three other campuses in Kansas City, St. Louis and Rollo. Campus housing, dining halls, libraries and broadband internet will remain available to students, the statement said.

Also on Friday, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, who is a physician, banned all events in the county attended by more than 250 people amid a flurry of closures of athletic events, parades and even church services.

Detection efforts also were intensifying. The Mercy health system announced that a drive-thru coronavirus testing facility could open as soon as Saturday in the St. Louis suburb of Chesterfield. Mercy said it also plans to open more testing sites in Missouri and the other three states where it operates — Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma.

Meanwhile, a Missouri health department spokeswoman said the agency is working to fix a glitch with a hotline the state set up to answer questions about the virus. Calls to the hotline from out-of-state numbers wouldn't go through as of Friday afternoon.

Missouri's first confirmed case of COVID-19 was a St. Louis-area woman in her 20s who had been studying in Italy and tested positive for the coronavirus last week after returning home.

The state's second case is a person in their early 20s who had recently traveled to Austria, Parson said Thursday. The patient was tested at a clinic in Springfield, is quarantined at home with mild symptoms and is expected to recover, Parson said.

Parson on Friday said the state is working out agreements to allow Washington University and the University of Missouri to conduct coronavirus tests and expand the state's testing capacity.

The World Health Organization has labelled the coronavirus a pandemic and President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

Kansas City Public Schools decided to close on Friday, one day before the start of spring break. Most students in the district receive free and reduced-priced lunch. Ray Weikal, a KCPS spokesman, said the district has been “planning for services like food distribution, virtual learning and deep cleaning in case we cancel school after spring break,"" The Kansas City Star reported.

“We know that our families depend on us for multiple services, and we commit to continuing to support our families in the event of future closures,” Weikal said.

The private Barstow School in Kansas City, canceled classes for Thursday and Friday ahead of a two-week spring break due to virus exposure concerns.

School officials said a family member of a school employee tested positive for COVID-19. School officials canceled classes as a precaution but said the infected person hasn't visited the campus, and the related school employee has shown no symptoms. No students or other school staff were exposed.

Spokeswoman Lisa Tulp said students and staff may be able to return March 30, or “we may have to move to online.”

Several universities in the state have moved to online classes.

Parson asked the Legislature to authorize $13 million in federal emergency funding to address the coronavirus.

Kansas City and St. Louis have banned all public events with more than 1,000 attendees. St. Patrick's Day parades in Kansas City, St. Louis and Springfield have been canceled. Six Flags St. Louis announced that it has suspended operation until at least the end of March.

Meanwhile, the Department of Corrections announced Thursday that Missouri’s 20 state-run prisons will be closed to visitors, with the exception of attorneys, for the next 30 days. Parson on Friday said the Department of Mental Health and Missouri veterans' homes also are restricting visitors.

St. Louis Circuit Court suspended all jury trials through April 13 and walk-in weddings at the county courthouse on Friday afternoons will be suspended on March 30 and April 3.

Entertainment venues in Kansas City and St. Louis also announced closings or cancellations for the next few weeks. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Arts in Kansas City will be closed Saturday through April 3 and the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts said it will postpone all events through April 1. Also, the St. Louis Art Museum and Contemporary Art Museum will remain open but are canceling tours, special events and lectures starting Sunday through April 30.

Churches also were calling off services, including the Church of the Resurrection, which has the largest Methodist congregation in the U.S. with over 20,000 members. The megachurch's main campus is in Leawood, Kansas, but it has campuses on the Missouri side of the line.",15544,NA

""Dear County Residents,

We realize that the current Coronavirus pandemic is causing a great deal of anxiety and concern. concerns about school closings, job issues and where to find basic necessities is making daily life more difficult. Life as we know it has changed and will remain different for weeks to come. No one knows how long these changes will have to stay in place. We do know that the more everyone works together to stop the spread of the disease, the more quickly life will return to normal.

The leadership of the county and city and their partners are working together to implement plans that have been in place for a number of years as well as developing new plans to address the different challenges this particular virus has caused. The decision to issue an Emergency Declaration by the County was to provide clear guidance on what is expected of our community, acknowledge this is an emergency situation and open up resources to support the response of our government entities, we are trying to provide the most up to date information available, but information is changing very quickly.

The Pettis County Health Center and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services along with the CDC are the best places to look for correct, factual information. There is a lot of misinformation circulating around social media.

One major area of concern is related to testing for the Coronavirus. There has been a lot of information from the Federal government that testing will be widely available. There are more tests available than when testing began and more coming. Testing is for people who are ill with a fever of 100.4, cough, shortness of breath and a risk factor including travel to specific countries and counties or direct contact with a person who has a lab confirmed case of Coronavirus.

When drive-through testing becomes available, we will let the community know where and how to obtain the test. New testing facilities are coming on line quickly. There should be enough testing materials available by April I, please be patient — people are being tested based on symptoms, not who they are. If you feel you have symptoms, please call your doctor before going to the office. Do not go to the Emergency Room unless you are seriously ill.

If you are told that you may have been exposed to the virus and are sent home, that means you need to stay IN YOUR HOME for 14 days. This does not mean going to the store or visiting with friends. If you need help with getting groceries or medicines, reach out to friends and families who may be able to take care of those items- We are working on setting up a telephone line for community residents to call if there is no one else who can help you get what you need.

As the guidance from Governor Parson regarding public gathering is changing we are following the first guidance he outlined. However, if at all possible, groups should be limited to 10 people until the end of March. Listed below is what needs to happen

1. All events that would have more than 50 people are to be cancelled or rescheduled. This includes meetings, weddings, concerts, plays, event barns/venues, social clubs and fund raising events. We are asking businesses to work with customers who must reschedule events. Please support the important charitable organizations that had fundraisers scheduled during the next several months.

2. The Governor's direction does not include schools, child care facilities and businesses. However, restaurants and bars are considered public gathering spaces which are addressed separately. Those organizations will make closing decisions based on information from state agencies and public health officials. All of these organizations are working with public health about closures decisions.

3. Restaurants and bars need to limit the number of people in the facility to 50 or less at a time. There should be encouragement for patrons to wash their hands, for those restaurants that can, takeout and delivery should be used as much as possible. All restaurants should remove items that are touched by multiple people such as ketchup bottles, salt and pepper and other common items. Menus should be cleaned between customers. We have been asked to do this for at least the next 15 days.

When shopping, please support our local businesses if possible. Some of our local businesses have on line shopping options that will help us through this situation. Supporting our local businesses will help them to survive and be there when life returns to normal. Please do not buy more than you need, we need to have enough food and necessities for all of our community.

We all need to continue to do those things that help keep us safe — stay home if you are sick, wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, eyes and mouth, stay home as much as possible. Staying home is very important for those over 65 years of age, have chronic illnesses or have a decreased immune system. Please do not go to visit people in the hospital if you are sick. The hospital is closed to visitors. However, please do call and check on your family and neighbors to ensure they have what they need such as medicines and food.

This pandemic will pass we just do not know how long it will take. Everyone will need to be patient as we all learn to live with a slower pace of life. Take time to catch up with people you have been meaning to call, write a letter or send a card to brighten the day of another, talk to your family. Try to view this as the pause in a busy life not something that is impossible to live with.""",42205,2020-03-20

The Phelps County Commission approved a State of Emergency Declaration for the county to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Phelps County.

The State of Emergency goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, and will be reassessed on April 2.

The Rolla Rural Fire Protection District said the commissioners approved the State of Emergency Declaration partly due to the current spread of the virus along with the first case of COVID-19 confirmed in Pulaski County.

The Pulaski County Health Center announced they received notification of the first confirmed case of a Pulaski County resident testing positive for COVID-19, on Thursday. The health center then recommended that on Friday all public and private schools remain closed for at least 14 days, and ordered all restaurants and bars to no longer offer dine-in services.

Drive-thru and carryout orders are still permitted, the health center said in a release.

The health center says the patient’s identity will remain confidential, but the case does not appear to be travel related.

The health center said they are working with the individual to make sure they are following Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) and Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. The patient is currently in isolation, the health center said.

The county health center is now working with the DHSS to conduct an investigation to identify any individuals that may have come in close contact with the patient, and will monitor them for symptoms and assist in the containment of the virus.

""It is important that every member of the community continue to follow the CDC basic hygiene preventative measures. These measures include: avoiding contact with people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes, proper hand-washing, cleaning frequently used surfaces, and staying home when sick,"" the health center said.

The Rolla Rural Fire Protection District said they along with other emergency services in Phelps County have now changed some of their response protocols, and ask that if residents have an emergency to call 911 and tell the dispatchers if they are feeling ill or running a temperature.

Rolla Rural said individuals that come into contact with their personnel on call should tell them that same information. “Even if you do not have these symptoms, we may provide you with a surgical style mask and ask that you wear it during the time you are in contact with us,” the department said on Thursday.

Rolla Rural Fire Protection District said staff will now wear extra personal protective equipment to ensure their own safety.

As of Tuesday afternoon, there were no confirmed cases in Randolph County.

Two more COVID-19 tests have come back negative, but more testing is being done, said Randolph County Health Department Administrator Sharon Whisenand.

The commission’s action is meant to be a proactive response and as a way to obtain possible Federal Emergency Management Respond funding, said Presiding Commissioner John Truesdell.

""What we did today will go a long way to help us so that as we starting feeling the crunch of what it does to us financially,"" he said. ""We’ll be able to tap into some federal funding and maybe replenish some of the money that we’re spending.""

The decision was made Tuesday morning after the commission met with health department and other county officials.

""We don’t want anybody to panic because we did this,"" said Westren District Commissioner John Hobbs said. ""But if you’re feeling bad, you need to stay home.""

The declaration also forms a County Emergency Operations Center, which Whisenand will spearhead.

""We are wanting everything to be directed through Sharon, because she is the most involved,"" Hobbs said.

After speaking with Gov. Mike Parson, state and local health officials Tuesday afternoon, it is apparent that it is only a matter of time before a case is confirmed in Randolph County, Truesdell said.

""What I’m getting from all of the sources is that if you haven’t got a confirmed case in your county, hang around because it’s coming,"" Truesdell said.

The commission will have weekly teleconferences with Parson and officials from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, he said.

""I thought that was really worth while, because we didn’t get bogus information,"" Truesdell said.

Despite many events being canceled and organizations, businesses and government buildings closing their doors to the public, the courthouse will remain open for now, he said.

""Our goal is to keep all government services up and running,"" Truesdell said.

The Lincoln County Board of Commissioners declared a countywide state of emergency in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic during its March 18 meeting.

Coming on the heels of President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration and Gov. Steve Bullock’s proclamation of a state of emergency for Montana, the county-level resolution gives the board authority to raise two mills in response to the crisis.

Dollars raised by an emergency levy can only be spent with the unanimous decision of county commissioners, according to state code. Money raised during a crisis that goes unspent must be set aside for future emergencies.

County Commissioner Jerry Bennett (D-2), who made the motion to declare a state of emergency, said the board had no immediate plans to raise money.

“I move to approve, but just with the clear understanding that this is just a formality,” he said.

The board voted unanimously to approve the measure.

Commissioner Mark Peck (D-1) said there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the county as yet, but wanted to ensure the board was getting accurate and up-to-date information from the jurisdiction’s health department. Commissioners broke from the meeting’s agenda to call health officials in for an unplanned public briefing.

“I think it would be good for them to be briefing us,” Peck said. “Our public health folks should probably be shooting us daily updates on what’s going on.”

During the briefing, Health Department Director Kathi Hooper sought permission to hire temporary staff to help with virus testing. Asked how many, Hooper and Public Health Director Jennifer McCully said at least one more person to start.

Currently, the department has a single staff member handling testing countywide. Trying to cover Eureka, Libby and Troy has left resources stretched thin, Hooper said.

“We lose her for half a day when she has to run up to Eureka for testing,” she said. “We’re hoping to hire a 90 day temp up in Eureka, [someone] who is a nurse who could respond when needed for testing.”

Instead, commissioners directed the department to hire two temporary staff members immediately. They gave Hooper and McCully permission to hire a third if necessary.

“It would not hurt to find three and hire two right away,” Peck said.

McCully and Hooper told the commissioners they already had a person in mind in Eureka. The challenge with hiring two additional staffers would be finding candidates with the necessary qualifications, McCully said.

Because of the logistical limitations on COVID-19 tests, the health department staff is continuing to meet with individuals who may have been exposed to the virus. Were tests to become available in mass quantities, officials could create a centralized site, McCully said.

In other parts of the country, like California, Massachusetts and Texas, drive through coronavirus testing facilities have sprung up.

For now, though, officials in Lincoln County want residents who suspect they may have the illness to contact the health department at 406-293-6295.

“I would like to, for as long as possible, meet people where they are at … until we are in a place to do drive through testing,” McCully said.

On the same day, officials with the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office announced the discontinuation of non-emergency business. That includes canceling jail visitations; the 24/7 alcohol-screening program and drug patches; issuing concealed weapon permits and renewals; and conducting background check fingerprints and VIN inspections. Fees incurred for late concealed weapons permit renewals as a result of the measures would be waived, officials wrote in a statement.

Detention center personnel will no longer accept money for inmates through the sheriff’s office lobby, officials said. Instead, cash, check or money orders could be sent to 512 California Avenue addressed to the inmate and the detention center.

Officials also warned that the agency will employ a “limited patrol response” for incidents where a crime has not been committed and there are no safety or security concerns.

Authorities urged residents to file reports by phone at 406-293-4112 ext. 1231.

“The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office will continue to actively patrol our community to provide the safety and security of our citizens,” read the statement. “However, we are taking the above precautions to both limit exposure and the potential of carrying and passing COVID-19.”",19460,2020-03-22

Meagher County Commissioners signed an emergency declaration this afternoon due to a power outage that began this morning. County residents, like those in the town of White Sulphur Springs, have been without power since around 8 a.m.

According to Rick Seidlitz, the Meagher County fire chief and disaster and emergency service coordinator, the county is working to help residents affected by the outage.

""Our biggest concern is our large elderly population, and a lot of them are on oxygen,"" he said. ""And their condensers don’t work with no power either, so they’re on regular oxygen tanks.""

Seidlitz says they are working to distribute tanks to those who may have run out.

He says the outage has affected many businesses, including gas stations which couldn’t pump fuel.

Schools also faced problems as NorthWestern Energy originally said the problem would be fixed within two hours.

“You know, at 8:00, they were trying to determine if they were going to send the kids home or keep them,"" Seidlitz said. ""The information they got was they only needed two hours. Well they could deal with that. Two hours passed and they said, 'well another two hours.' Well that gets them into lunch. And they said, ‘well it’s only going to be another two hours so we can keep them.’ Well of course they didn’t have any power for lunch.”

NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Brandy Powers says an equipment failure at the Two Dot substation led to the outage.

“You know, as we assess the line, I mean, we’re trying to provide accurate information and restoring power as soon as possible. Because this was a breaker issue, as power is restored, it doesn’t hold, so they are continuing to try and make the fix.”

Powers says crews have been working since this morning, and they hope to have power restored by 6 p.m. She says the outage impacted around 1,400 customers.",1937,NA

Instead, Hoffman noted it's the job in a public health emergency ""for the county's health officer to take those steps"".

To that end, Commissioner Jeff Burrows said he was recommending that County Health Officer Carol Calderwood take over as the Incident Commander of the Incident Management Team that was formed earlier this week.

Commissioners said they appreciate the people who are taking ""positive steps"" already to combat any spread of the virus, including restaurants who have voluntarily closed their dining rooms.



Commissioner Jeff Burrows believes those measures are ""a big part of the reason"" Ravalli County hasn't seen a confirmed COVID-19 case.

""We would encourage people to remain calm"", Hoffman said, urging people to not overbuy groceries and other supplies. ""That's not the Bitterroot.""

The step comes just days after the county implemented an Incident Management Team to bring together the county and other agencies to craft a response to the growing emergency.

That was seen as a way to bring all partners together to consider solutions, but also to improve communications between agencies and the public.

As of Friday morning, Ravalli County remained one of the counties in Montana that had no positive COVID-19 cases.

Linder said the jail conducts a basic physical and mental health assessment upon booking, and jail staff will add a screening for the new coronavirus to the process.

In addition, inmates scheduled for court hearings on Monday and Tuesday mornings were instead kept at the jail and seen over video in an effort to reduce foot traffic at the courthouse, according to Yellowstone County District Judge Rod Souza.

Billings police officers were also taking extra precautions, like social distancing practices within the department and postponing travel and training, according to a Monday afternoon release from the BPD.

Officers will also “attempt to avoid all non-essential close contact (within 6 feet) of interacting with others,” and arrests will only be made as required by law or if an individual presents a danger to the community.

Novel Coronavirus - COVID-19 (AP)

Nye County has declared a local emergency in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

On Wednesday night, the county said it had confirmed its first case of COVID-19 in a Beatty resident.

On Thursday morning, the county issued a news release saying a “declaration of existence of local emergency” was issued by county leaders, including county manager Tim Sutton, County Commission Chair John Koenig, director of Emergency Management Scott Lewis and Sheriff Sharon Wehrly. The declaration reads:

“In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to better protect the citizens of Nye County, I am issuing the attached Emergency Declaration,” Sutton said in a statement. “This is being done in an abundance of caution and is similar to the declaration issued during the recent Storm Area 51 event. The Board of County Commissioners is unable to meet at this time due to restrictions on public gatherings but the board will have the opportunity to review and ratify this declaration at a future meeting.

“Several other Nevada counties have taken this precautionary step, which allows for quicker response in times of emergencies. The declaration is also necessary to qualify for state and federal grant funding so we can hopefully offset some of the costs associated with fighting, treating, and containing the virus. Thank you all for your patience during this challenging time, and please know that we are doing all we can to reopen our offices and provide full county services.”

The first Nye County resident to have a confirmed positive test for COVID-19 was described in a county Facebook post as a male patient is in his 60s who lives in Beatty, where he is self-quarantined at home.

“Emergency Services has made contact and is continuing to investigate the source of the infection and retracing his movements for the past few weeks,” the post said.

As a result, all nonessential employees and personnel in the county have been asked to work from home beginning Tuesday, officials said.

Government operations are reduced to only essential functions through March 31. All essential employees, such as law enforcement, corrections, public safety, and others as dictated will report to work as usual. Non-essential employees will not report to work but will remain on call to work remotely as needed.

""The declaration is being utilized to protect the public health and ensure personnel can be home to care for their families during this unprecedented time,"" Camden County Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli, Jr. said. ""This was not an easy decision to reach, however, our priority is to make judicious decisions that will benefit us all, flatten the curve, and reduce the spread of this virus. We will be constantly reevaluating our operations to ensure that we can provide these services while continuing to protect our employees and our residents.""



Officials are also asking all non-essential businesses in the county to consider voluntarily closing or modifying operations to comply with CDC social distancing recommendations.



""We acknowledge that this request is a tough pill to swallow, and we absolutely do not take that reality lightly, however sacrifices made today are necessary if we are to save lives tomorrow,"" Cappelli said. ""The science is clear — the more we restrict social interaction, the slower the spread of infection becomes, and the fewer lives ultimately lost. This has become a life or death situation and the time to act is now.""



The announcement came around the same time it was revealed that a third person in Camden County had tested positive for new coronavirus.

A woman in her 50s is currently in self-isolation in her Haddon Township home, officials said on Monday. She is maintaining frequent contact with the Camden County Health Department. Officials believe her initial contact came from an exposure at Newark International Airport. After that, they believe she has only been in contact with one other person, a friend, in addition to her family. Read more here: First Positive Case Of Coronavirus Identified In Haddon Township

The New Jersey Department of Health has partnered with the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System to open and operate a call center (1-800-222-1222) for public use regarding questions, concerns, and other information related to coronavirus spread in New Jersey. More information is also available on the state's coronavirus webpage.

This declaration will enable the county’s Office of Emergency Management -- with the concurrence of the Hunterdon County Health Office -- to request assistance from New Jersey and the Federal government. This assistance encompasses the providing of material resources from the Strategic National Stockpile that can support the Hunterdon Medical Center as well as other county health care facilities, according to a press release.

“Officials within the county have been hard at work addressing the public health emergency posed by coronavirus,"" Freeholder Director Shaun Van Doren said in the release. “The Hunterdon County Health Department and Office of Emergency Management have been working around the clock to plan and respond to the constantly evolving challenges posed by coronavirus.”

The decision comes the same day Gov. Phil Murphy announced further measures to try and slow the spread of the virus.

In signing this declaration of a state of emergency on Monday, Van Doren also announced that the county offices will remain open despite the closing and suspension of other operations or events.

In addition to the county libraries, set to close Tuesday at 5 p.m., access to the county Senior Center is suspended through to April 6. On that day, the suspension will be re-evaluated.

All senior activities, including congregate meals, are suspended, though Meals on Wheels of Hunterdon County will continue to drop off meals to its patrons using a method that eliminates personal interaction between participants and volunteers.

The Division of Parks & Recreation is temporarily suspending programs and closing visitor centers to the public, though parks trails will remain open. The division’s staff will refund those affected by the suspension, and continue to be available via email and telephone for public inquiries and reservations.

This suspension will be reevaluated on March 31. The parks staff are currently exploring options to offer educational resources online through its website and Facebook page.

The Board of Elections office will be closed to the public, but staff will continue to administer election procedures at a table in the lobby, where the public can come in and fill out any forms that they need and leave them in the lock box for processing.

The Searching the Search Room event scheduled for Saturday has been cancelled, as has the HackHunterdon Monthly Tech Meetup scheduled for March 26.

The county’s electronics waste cleanup scheduled for Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. has not been cancelled or postponed, though the county is encouraging participants to remain in their vehicles when dropping off material. All electronic waste should be placed in the trunk, cargo area or truck beds of the vehicles so they are easily accessible to the staff removing it.

The county Health Department will continue to provide essential services to residents and businesses but encourages the electronic transfer of documents and the conducting of business over the phone when possible. A drop-off process has been instituted outside of the Health Department’s office if residents cannot be serviced over the phone.

County residents interested in applying for SNAP food assistance or cash assistance under the Work First New Jersey program are encouraged by the Department of Human Services to to visit NJHelps.org. Social Services can conduct interviews by phone, and residents are encouraged to call Social Services at 908-788-1300 if they have an emergency housing need.

The Greater Raritan One-Stop Career Training Service Centers in Flemington and Somerville are closed to in-person visits, and staff will continue to assist customers over the phone and via email. Customers are encouraged to call 908-541-5780 or email onestop@co.somerset.nj.us for assistance.

According to Van Doren, these closures and readjustments will all be “reevaluated on an ongoing basis” in consultation with both the county Department of Health and in accordance with CDC guidelines.

“As conditions on the ground change and the risk of coronavirus subsides, the county will aim to scale back these policies,” Van Doren said. ""We must remember that as Americans we are in this fight together, and by taking these measures now we will help to mitigate against additional exposures and serious health outcomes.”

On Thursday, March 12, Mercer County Executive Brian Hughes issued an executive order announcing a county-wide state of emergency to aid the fight against COVID-19.

The announcement follows New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s proclamation of a state of emergency Monday night.

Executive Order 2020-01 declared that Mercer County agencies are “authorized to take appropriate action to assist municipal governments in containing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from this COVID-19 outbreak.”

Mercer County will be following infectious disease guidelines and protocol as given by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The County Health Officer can alter sanitary and health codes to combat the disease. County employees are banned from out-of-state business-related travel.

All public gatherings of more than 250 people have been canceled. McCarter Theater has also suspended all performances, classes, and events through March 31 to abide by this guideline.

""We understand that our residents are concerned about this rapidly evolving situation, and we're determined to take whatever steps are necessary to minimize the risks for the people of Mercer County,"" Hughes said.

The executive order also allows Mercer County to seek reimbursement from the federal government for measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

While no Mercer County residents have been diagnosed with COVID-19, one Burlington County resident who works in Robbinsville Township is the first presumed positive case to be associated with Mercer County. Five out-of-state attendees of a party in Princeton have also been diagnosed with the disease. Additionally, two University staff members who were at this party are still waiting for their test results.",370414,NA

Resolution could qualify Luna County for state and federal emergency funding

District 1 Commissioner Barbara Reedy listens at right. (Photo: Bill Armendariz - Headlight Photo)

DEMING – Luna County Commissioners voted unanimously to approve County Resolution 20-25, declaring a county-wide state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic that is gripping the nation. The resolution was adopted at noon on Monday during a special meeting of the Luna County Board of Commissioners.

As of Sunday evening, the New Mexico Department of Health has confirmed 65 positive cases in the state, including four cases in nearby Dona Ana County. This comes from https://cv.nmhealth.org/ where reports indicate 5,386 COVID-19 tests have been performed and 5,321 have come back negative.

“Definitely respect the social distancing at this time and limit travel only for essential needs,” said Luna County Manager Chris Brice. “The virus itself is not that dangerous to the majority of the population, but if we get enough people who are infected then out hospitals get overrun and the physical capacity to isolate a great number of people becomes a problem.”

The county-wide state of emergency is a necessary resolution to allow Luna County government to apply for state and federal relief funds during this global crisis. “COVID-19 is certainly something we have to guard against, but the economic impact of this is also a concern,"" Brice said.

Brice also noted $50,000 has been put on a separate line item to handle immediate expenditures the county must track. Luna County's Starmax Family Entertainment Center and the Mimbres Valley Special Events Center have been shut down and are directly impacted by the state mandates.

The migrant relief crisis in Luna County of 2019 was a valuable lesson to county government. The county is still seeking reimbursement for the expenditures during the 31,000 Central American migrants who purged through Luna County seeking asylum.

“Essentially our chain of command has been established through emergency management and we are more familiar with the operations,” Brice explained in terms of preparation for this event. “We are better prepared.”

District 2 Commissioner Linda Smrkovsky told the Headlight the resolution needed to be put forth to follow the state and federal guidelines and to ensure the safety of the citizens of Luna County. “We need to be cautious at this time, and this measure will help us in the long run.”

The meeting was attended by a few county employees and a handful of citizens, as county officials recommended the public stay at home. Seating arrangements distanced the audience six feet apart during the meeting.

“This is costing the county money in different areas,” said District 3 Commissioner John Sweetser. “If there is money available from state or federal, this resolution puts us in line for that.”

Brice reminded citizens to support local businesses through the state mandated health order. “Order take-out service at our local restaurants. Buy gift cards from businesses. They need your support now while our economy is hurting.”

Update from county

Chemung County Director of Public Health Peter Buzzetti said the potential global public health risk is high, but the immediate risk in Chemung County right now is low.

Buzzetti said, ""You can still go grocery shopping, you can still go out and get something to eat, but it's the mass gatherings that are frowned upon.""

The health department staff meets daily to discuss the virus, and meets with local law enforcement to discuss COVID-19, Buzzetti said.

Regional preparedness was discussed last week between Chemung, Steuben and Schuyler county officials.

Buzzetti explained the case fatality rate for the flu in the country is .1%, for COVID-19, the case fatality rate is about 3.4%.

While some may fear opening packages that may have come from areas with people who have the virus, Buzzetti said the risk of catching it from a package is low.

Concerned residents can call a public health nurse at 607-727-2899.

The state Department of Health has a toll-free hotline, 888-364-3065, to answer questions about coronavirus and about the rules governing overseas travel.

Coronavirus symptoms

The symptoms of coronavirus can be similar to the flu or a bad cold. Symptoms include a fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Most healthy people will have mild symptoms. A study of more than 72,000 patients by the Centers for Disease Control in China showed 80 percent of the cases there were mild.

But infections can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death, according to the World Health Organization. Older people with underlying health conditions are most at risk.

The CDC believes symptoms may appear anywhere from two to 14 days after being exposed.

Human coronaviruses are usually spread through...

The air by coughing or sneezing

Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands

Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands.

Help stop the spread of coronavirus

Stay home when you are sick.

Eat and sleep separately from your family members

Use different utensils and dishes

Cover your cough or sneeze with your arm, hot your hand.

If you use a tissue, throw it in the trash.

Lower your risk

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

If you are 60 or over and have an underlying health condition such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or respiratory illnesses like asthma or COPD, the World Health Organization advises you to try to avoid crowds or places where you might interact with people who are sick.

BATAVIA — Genesee County is under a state of emergency due to coronavirus (COVID-19), county Legislature Chair Rochelle Stein said tonight.

“Over the past week, COVID-19 has evolved rapidly. While Genesee County has no confirmed cases, there are confirmed cases in neighboring counties and increased local testing. I believe it is inevitable we will see

cases here in Genesee County,” said Stein. “With this in mind and after discussion with Paul Pettit, director of the Genesee and Orleans County health departments, I am declaring a state of emergency for Genesee County. This declaration allows us to procure goods and services as well as required and availableassistance to municipalities and school districts. I am recommending that allschools in Genesee County close to students effective immediately for anundetermined amount of time.”

Pettit said, “We want to remind people the risk in our community still remains relatively low and these decisions are based on the need to slow transmission in our communities. Through ongoing discussions with all 10 school districts and county administration, this unified decision is based on the increased activity in our county and has led to these preventive measures.”

Kevin MacDonald, district superintendent of the Genesee Valley Educational Partnership, said in a statement, “in collaboration with the New York State and local departments of health, the component districts of the Genesee Valley Educational Partnership will be closed to students effective Monday, March 16, until further notice. Component districts will be sharing messages to their respective communities regarding details of their closures. We ask all our community members to take care of each other as we navigate this public health matter.”",59454,NA

Legislature Chairman Vincent Bono said in a statement Saturday evening that residents are asked to heed all federal, state and local protocols and recommendations to “ensure that you and your family are protected from this threat.”

“We are in constant contact with state officials and are working with them to provide vital assistance to the community. Avoid crowded areas and maintain clean practices,” Bono said in the statement.

The declaration signed by Bono stated the coronavirus outbreak has become a public health emergency of international concern and threatens the health and welfare of the citizens of Herkimer County.

The declaration gives Bono the authority to preserve public safety and render all required and available assistance vital to the security, well-being and health of the citizens of Herkimer County.

“I hereby direct all departments and agencies of Herkimer County to take whatever steps necessary to protect life and property, public infrastructure and provide such emergency assistance deemed necessary,” the declaration signed by Bono stated.

Bono also said Saturday that the Herkimer County resident who tested positive for coronavirus last week has been released from the hospital and is recovering at home.

It was announced Friday that all public schools within the county will be closed to students effective March 16. Classes will resume April 14.

Bono said Saturday all county departments will remain open until further notice.

Have questions about the new coronavirus? Here are some answers:

What are the symptoms of coronavirus?

The Centers for Control and Prevention say that fever, cough and shortness of breath often appear two to 14 days after exposure to the coronavirus. Emergency warning signs include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse and bluish lips or face. This and other concerning symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately, according to the CDC.

I think I have coronavirus. What should I do?

Call ahead before you visit a doctor and alert your local health department, according to the CDC. For example, the Slocum-Dickson Medical Group in New Hartford recently had to advise they are not a testing facility.

If you are sick with the coronavirus or suspect you are, the CDC recommends you stay home and separate yourself from other people and pets in your home. If it is confirmed you have the virus, you should remain home until transmission risk is low.

Take other precautions like wearing a face mask, washing your hands often and disinfecting surfaces.

So, who do I call to get tested?

Call your health care provider, says Oneida County Health Director Phyllis D. Ellis. Your doctor can discuss with you further about your specific case and they can arrange where and when you’ll get tested.

How does the test work?

Similar to getting tested for the flu, you are swabbed and that swab is delivered to a lab, says Ellis. The results vary, but it could take up to a couple of days, she says, and in the meantime, stay quarantined.

How does the virus spread?

The CDC reports that COVID-19, or the new coronavirus, appears to be spreading easily in affected areas. The virus mainly spreads person-to-person, such as by inhaling droplets from when a sick person coughs or sneezes, according to the CDC. It is also thought that someone could touch an object that has the virus on it, and then by touching their mouth, nose or eyes become infected. It is thought that the disease mainly spreads from those showing symptoms but has been reported to spread from those not showing symptoms.

There are confirmed cases of coronavirus in my area, how do I prevent the disease from spreading to me?

The CDC says the best way to prevent exposure is by washing your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water — and do it often, especially after being out in public, coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose. If you can’t wash your hands, use hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.

The CDC says you should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; avoid close contact with sick people, or the general public if the disease is spreading in your community.

You do not need to wear a face mask unless you are caring for someone who is sick and is not able to wear one, according to the CDC. Face masks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.

What risks do I have if I get coronavirus?

Those who are at a higher risk of getting sick from the disease include older adults and those with conditions like heart or lung disease and diabetes, according to the CDC. If that is the case, you must take extra caution. Stock up on supplies, keep 6 feet away from others, stay home as much as possible and avoid travel by air and cruise.

I’m pregnant and/or have children. What are the risks there?

There is no evidence that children are more susceptible to coronavirus, and most cases in China occurred in adults, according to the CDC. But infections in children have been reported, including in very young children.

Pregnancy can increase a risk for infection, but it is not yet known if this means a higher risk for coronavirus, the CDC says. It is not yet known if coronavirus can cause complications in pregnancy or be passed on to the baby, but in the small number of infants born to mother with coronavirus, none tested positive for the disease and the virus was not found in amniotic fluid or breast milk.

Anything else I should be doing to prepare?

The CDC recommends making sure you have enough household items, groceries and medication at home in case you have to self-quarantine. This includes asking your doctor or pharmacist about obtaining extra medication or using a mail-order prescription. Consider ways you can have food delivered to you either through a service or people you know.

Does this mean cutting myself off from everyone?

No. The CDC suggests keeping in touch with friends, family or community members for help. If you are caregiver, or have a caregiver, determine who takes care of them if they get sick, for example.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues to climb in Kings County as the novel virus continues to disrupt daily life in the borough.

By midday on March 12, health officials had documented over 24 infections in Brooklyn, and 95 citywide — lending Mayor Bill de Blasio to institute a state of emergency in the Five Boroughs, giving the city special powers to potentially restrict travel and exert more control over the functioning of hospitals.

“I don’t think for most of us who have been in public life for quite a long time we’ve seen a situation quite like this,” the mayor said.

New York State, which has been in a declared state of emergency since March 7, leads the nation with over 300 confirmed cases as of March 12.

At a press conference on the state’s response, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a mandatory cancellation of all gatherings with over 500 people.

Out of an abundance of precautions, however, a number of smaller events in Brooklyn have been canceled for fears that the virus might spread.

The Brooklyn Historical Society is shutting down until at least March 31.

The Brooklyn Public Library is halting public programming through at least March 31.

Brooklyn Museum is closed until further notice.

Both the Bay Ridge and Park Slope Saint Patrick’s Day parades are postponed indefinitely.

Under the governor’s mandate banning gatherings of over 500 people, the boroughs large venues including the Barclays Center and Kings Theatre will cease operation until further notice.

Bushwick nightclub House of Yes is shutting down starting Friday.

Most Brooklyn Community Boards are postponing their upcoming meetings.

Many Brooklyn private schools have closed, although Brooklyn’s public schools remain open — including a Park Slope elementary school where a parent tested positive for the virus .

Even with the suspicion of many large processions, the mayor grimly predicted that the citywide total would surpass 1,000 cases citywide by next week.

At a press conference on Saturday morning, County Executive Adam Bello declared a state of emergency for Monroe County as a result of the novel coronavirus.

He said it would give him the flexibility to make decisions necessary to keep the community safe.

But what does a state of emergency actually mean for Monroe County residents?

John Bringewatt, the county's attorney, said it essentially clears a path for Bello to make decisions and ""facilitate the ongoing response to the crisis.""

At the time of Saturday's press conference, Bello had also just announced Monroe County's second confirmed case of COVID-19. Two days later, there are now 10 confirmed cases, with several other patients waiting for test results.

As the situation escalates locally, Bringewatt said the declaration clears a path for Bello's administration to handle the crisis.

Here's a look at what declaring a state of emergency could allow Bello to do:

Though no action has been taken so far, Bringewatt said the situation is fluid and responses to the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the county will likely change, too.

""We haven't issued any emergency orders yet,"" he said. ""This gives him — 'this' being the declaration of the state of emergency — gives him the authority to issue those orders if he needs to, and to do it immediately.""

Niagara County Legislature Chairwoman Becky Wydysh addresses the media.

Though Niagara County still has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, a state of emergency was declared Sunday – and all school districts will be closed Monday.

Niagara County Legislature Chairwoman Becky Wydysh held a press conference at the Warren J. Rathke Public Safety Training Facility in Lockport to announce these measures.

“There are no positive cases that have been confirmed in Niagara County as of yet, however, yesterday afternoon, we did see Monroe County announce positive cases, and then declare a state of emergency,” Wydysh said. “Neighboring Orleans County also then announced their own state of emergency. Late last evening, three positive cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Erie County; followed by their declaration of state of emergency just this morning.”

She added, “At this time, with our surrounding counties having done so, we feel it is the appropriate preemptive action to declare a state of emergency here in Niagara County, as of 2 p.m. today.

“Declaring state of emergency allows us the authority and the ability to implement public-protective measures, and continue to receive state and federal resources – should we need them.

“We know that coronavirus is moving in our direction, and that we will likely have positive cases in the near future.”

Wydysh read a statement from the gathered superintendents that stated, “Niagara County has issued a state of emergency and the Niagara County Health Department has recommended that all schools be closed for students effective Monday, March 16, and until further notice. …

“Districts will reassess student attendance weekly. Districts will be providing separate information on staff attendance, academics and food service.”

This closure applies to the Albion, Barker, Lockport, Lewiston-Porter, Medina, Niagara-Wheatfield, North Tonawanda, Newfane, Niagara Falls, Starpoint, Royalton-Hartland, Lyndonville and Wilson school districts.

Lewiston-Porter Superintendent of Schools Paul Casseri said updates would be provided on the district website, https://www.lew-port.com/.

“We are beginning a plan in place to have meals delivered; we want to get that up and running by Tuesday or Wednesday of this week for those students on free and reduced (meal plans),” he said. “All of our students have one-to-one computing, so we’re working on opportunities for students to access work so that we can mitigate any learning regression that may occur for the length of time that we're out.

“Our most important concern is to keep our students safe, our families safe, and our staff safe. Every decision we’re making is based on that.”

Interim Niagara County Sheriff Michael Filicetti provides an update.

Wydysh was joined by Niagara County Director of Public Health Daniel Stapleton, Emergency Services Director Jonathan Schultz, Interim Sheriff Michael Filicetti and Dr. Clark Godshall of Orleans/Niagara BOCES.

Stapleton emphasized, “We are operating as if this coronavirus is already here in Niagara County.”

He explained, “We have 12 individuals that are quarantined in their home. We have done a number of testings, and so far we do not have a case in Niagara County.

“We’re not waiting for a positive case to dictate what we do. We’re looking at the science; we’re looking at the facts; and we’re making decisions based on conversations we’ve had with our experts – and will continue to do that.”

Stapleton explained, “We all know there’s no vaccination for coronavirus; and the earliest possible date we’re looking at is 12-18 months. More likely 18 months. Also, antivirals are not effective. Those, hopefully, will be available within four to five months.”

Godshall said he expected the superintendents to convene and provide another media update in a week.

Wydysh noted, “At this time, it is not our intention to close county buildings, as we do provide necessary services to our residents. We do, however, ask that everyone use good common sense and follow the CDC guidelines when you’re deciding whether or not you should be coming into those offices – for your health, and for that of our employees.”

Both Wydysh and Stapleton advised people to follow Centers for Disease Control preventative measures, such as washing hands; avoiding contact with one’s eyes, nose or mouth; and staying home when possible or when symptomatic.

“Please remember that many of our services can be completed by a phone call or through mail, and we ask you to do that whenever possible,” Wydysh said. “We also ask you to do that in other areas of your life. Take precautions where you can. When shopping, seeking entertainment, visiting friends and family – again, not just for your health, but for those who you might come into contact with, who have underlying health concerns.”

Stapleton said, “Do those things that you can do on a daily basis to reduce the risk to you and those that you love.

“Also, if you have symptoms consistent with coronavirus – which are identical to the seasonal flu – call your personal physicians before you go to their office. Do not go there directly; talk to them. If you do not have a primary care physician or can’t get a hold of yours, and you’re going to an immediate care center, or the local emergency department, call them first. Don’t go there. Don't go there and spread the disease that you might have.”

Last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued state declarations limiting attendance at public events to less than 500 people, mandating smaller events and restaurants cut their capacity by 50%, and stating only medically necessary visits will be allowed at nursing homes.

""Without a cohesive message, there is fear,"" Day told the crowd gathered on the steps. including Rockland County Commissioner of Health, Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert, all of the county's public schools superintendents and members of the Rockland County Legislature.

Ruppert urged residents to staying home as much as possible because exposure to the virus could happen anywhere in the county. Those who can work from home should do so, she said.

""I have been advising for a week that people practice social distancing,"" Ruppert said, referring to the practice of keeping 6 feet between individuals. ""Now I want residents to consider staying home as much as you can.""

Schools to close

All public schools that serve grades K-12 are to suspend all classroom and extracurricular functions starting Tuesday. The closure will be for two weeks.

Private schools must close starting Wednesday.

Rabbi Yisroel Kahan, executive director of Oizrim Jewish Council, attended the county press conference to hear the latest.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced similar school closures Monday, due to start Wednesday.

Day's order also mandates that universities, colleges and other public and private educational facilities shut to all students by Wednesday, except for resident students, who will be allowed to access dorms and dining facilities.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday that as schools shut down, he wanted schools to figure out childcare options for essential personnel, like medical providers and first responders. Officials said that local options for that are still being worked out.

Rockland BOCES Superintendent Mary Jean Marsico said the public schools were committed to making sure children would have their nutritional and educational needs met during the closure.

Public schools have come up with ways to deliver food to students who receive free and reduced meals at school. ""We're not here to make things worse,"" Marsico said. ""We're here to accommodate.""

Nyack public schools, for example, developed food delivery sites at the Nyack Center and Waldron Terrace. Community members, including school board trustees, were on hand Monday at Nyack Center to pack up and pass out bagged breakfast and lunch. Food will be distributed every day from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. until school is back in session, district officials said.

Andrew Cuomo said in a conference call with reporters.

The governor also announced the state would be opening a drive-thru coronavirus testing facility for Rockland this week, although he didn't pinpoint a location. Last Friday the state put up a tent at the Anthony Wayne Recreation Area, but it was taken down the following day.

Washington County declared a state of emergency Friday in response to the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on southwestern Utah.

The three-member county commission voted unanimously for the measure, which they said should help stabilize local businesses, at a special meeting in St. George.

The declaration includes three categories of focus to assist the local economy -- a “Stay Greater” campaign to encourage residents to order take out meals from local restaurants, a small business stabilization loan program and a program to distribute accurate information to the area’s most vulnerable, specifically seniors.

“We’re not trying to send additional concern into the community, this is an action we have to take because we want to bring solutions to the table,” Commission Chair Victor Iverson said.

Commissioner Dean Cox, who had served as an emergency services director for 20 years, said this is only the seventh or eighth time the county has taken such measures. Nationally, President Donald Trump has announced a national emergency. Also on the state level, Gov. Gary Herbert has made similar declarations.

Cox said it’s unusual to see the emergency declarations going from the top down, saying usually they start on a local level. However, the commissioners said they wanted to communicate to the public that the county is using available resources to help people who are struggling at this time.

“We have two pandemics going on, the coronavirus is a pandemic. But I believe we have a pandemic of fear going on … we’re not trying to spread more fear, we’re in this together with business owners [and residents],” Iverson said.

The crisis has forced widespread closures and cancelations across southwestern Utah. Public schools are closed, area church services are on hold and various businesses from restaurants to retail stores have either scaled back hoursor closed completely.

Popular events like the IRONMAN St. George have been postponed, and county efforts to attract tourism dollars have been rolled back.

Utah has now reported a total of 112 cases of the new coronavirus, an increase of 33 over the previous day, according to an update posted Friday by the state health department.

The figures include 102 Utah residents and 10 visitors, with most of the cases reported so far out of northern Utah. Salt Lake County had reported 44 cases, with 28 out of Summit County.

Southwestern Utah has only one confirmed case so far, and that resident is the same person who was reported several weeks ago after returning from a cruise.

A total of 2,147 people had been tested statewide.

President Donald Trump announced new federal actions Friday in efforts to slow the spread of the new coronavirus and relieve the economic effects of the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Tax Day has been moved back to July. And California, New York and Pennsylvania took the boldest action yet to slow the spread of coronavirus.

The U.S. hit two grim landmarks on Friday — at least 210 deaths and over 14,600 confirmed cases. Worldwide, the death toll has topped 10,400, as Italy saw its biggest one-day increase on Friday. There are more than 255,000 confirmed cases around the globe, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.

WHITE PLAINS – Westchester County Executive George Latimer declared a State of Emergency Monday as the fight to slow the coronavirus outbreak grinds most aspects of daily life to a halt.

Latimer’s emergency declaration and a related executive order will shut down all public and private schools in the county for a minimum of two weeks starting Wednesday. Westchester has 44 public schools and the majority decided to close on their own prior to the order.

The declaration follows an order by the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut that will close casinos, gyms and movie theaters and limit bars and restaurants to delivery and takeout. All public functions of 50 people or more are on hold in an effort to maximize social distancing.

“We’re all very much aware that we’re facing something that we’ve never faced before,” Latimer said at a news conference on the steps of the Michaelian municipal building. “We’re going through a test the likes of which we have not experienced in our adult lifetime here in this country and we’re trying to make decisions as we go along to the best of our ability.”

Westchester was an early hot spot of positive tests for the coronavirus, leading the state government to set up a “containment area” in the city of New Rochelle. County-owned Glen Island Park is now the site of a state-run testing center where those with appointments drive up and are tested from their cars.

Sherlita Amler, county commissioner of health, said efforts like the closure of schools should be taken seriously to reduce the risk of exposure. The ultimate goal is to try to reduce the number of people needing medical attention at the same time.

There is no vaccine or accepted medical treatment for the virus and hospitals can't handle the projected peaks. That is why social distancing is important, Amler said at the news conference.

""If we do these things, we can keep these numbers low,"" Amler said. ""If we don’t do these things, we could see these numbers dramatically rise which is exactly what we’re trying to prevent.""

Alternate medical sites

Latimer said the county is looking at sites that serve as emergency medical areas in the face of a surge of needed hospital beds. Other sites in the county could be used to isolate those who’ve contracted the virus who might not be able to self-quarantine.

Potential sites named by Latimer include Dorral Arrowwood, a recently-closed hotel and conference center in Rye Brook, the long shuttered United Hospital in Port Chester and the former College of New Rochelle.

County-owned parks, including Rye Playland amusement park, could potentially be used as additional drive through testing sites if needed by the state. As of Monday, there were 950 confirmed cases in New York, with seven deaths related to the virus and its resulting disease COVID-19.

Westchester has 220 confirmed cases, and Latimer said the county is working to share breakdown by municipalities to help local law enforcement. An estimated 17% of state cases have resulted in hospitalization, Latimer said.

The disruption in social norms and the economy is secondary to limiting the spread of the global pandemic and saving lives.

“Until the contagion is controlled and reversed we are in a free fall situation with the society economically,” Latimer said, and noted it was not just a local problem. “When the contagion is over, when it has run its course, when we see just how successful we are or are not, we’re going to have a large economic hole to dig out.”

Latimer’s declaration will last at least 30 days, unless he rescinds it before then. The closure of schools can be extended beyond 14 days if needed. Further coronavirus-related executive orders may follow as needed, he said.

The county action follows a state of emergency declaration from Gov. Andrew Cuomo on March 7 and a national emergency declaration from President Donald Trump on March 13.

Neighboring Putnam County declared a state of emergency on Friday and Rockland County also issued an emergency declaration Monday.

WARSAW — Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19), a state of emergency will go into effect in Wyoming County at 12 a.m. Sunday, the Wyoming County Health Department said tonight.

COVID-19 is an infection associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness. It appears to be transmitted from person to person predominantly through droplet transmission and, if spread in the population, could have significant public health consequences, the health department said.

“Although there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Wyoming County to date, this situation is rapidly evolving and the threat of this virus is imminent to the citizens and visitors of Wyoming County,” the county said. “It is necessary that Wyoming County be proactive and fully prepared to deal with its effects.”

Wyoming County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jerry Davis said today, “I ... exercise the authority given me ... under New York State Executive Law, for the purpose of procuring goods and services and to render all required and available assistance to municipalities and school districts that is vital to the security, well-being and health and safety of the citizens of Wyoming County.

“The state of emergency does not, in any way, impact travel and county operations will continue unchanged unless otherwise advised,” Davis said. “I hereby direct all departments and agencies of Wyoming County to take the steps necessary to protect life and property, public infrastructure and provide such emergency assistance deemed necessary. The state of emergency will remain in effect for 30 days or until rescinded or renewed by a subsequent order.”

In a proactive move, the Alexander County Board of Commissioners declared a State of Emergency for COVID-19 (coronavirus). Commissioners held an emergency meeting with county staff on Tuesday, March 17 to discuss the virus and ways to contain the spread of the illness locally.

Commissioners heard reports from Emergency Services, Health Department, Social Services, and Administration, as well as information from a conference call with the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners which provided updates from various state agencies.

“Alexander County currently has zero confirmed cases of COVID-19, but we felt it would be a wise decision to be proactive and let our citizens know that we believe this could become a very serious health issue. The declaration also positions the county for potential state and federal funds if conditions worsen,” said Ryan Mayberry, Chairman of the Alexander County Board of Commissioners. “With this declaration, we are getting ahead of the game, and will hopefully increase awareness of this virus and save lives. Please take this seriously. The magnitude of this virus and its effect on our county, state, nation, and world is not yet known, but together we will get through this potential crisis and emerge even stronger.”

Leeanne Whisnant, Director of Alexander County Consolidated Human Services, informed the board that while there are no confirmed cases yet, there are five (5) households under quarantine after being tested for the virus. Test results are still pending as the tests require 12-72 hours in a lab. If positive, the test will then be sent to a CDC lab, which requires an additional 12-72 hours for results.

“The health, safety, and welfare of our citizens is paramount as we all work together to contain this pandemic,” Whisnant related. “We encourage our citizens to practice good hygiene and use common sense to help us contain this virus. The more we can all stay at home and have less interaction with others, the better off we will be and the less this highly-contagious virus will spread in Alexander County and beyond. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation.”

Following the emergency meeting, Alexander County Government has implemented a mitigation strategy to slow the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus), including the closing of certain facilities, reduced staffing, canceling meetings and events, and other measures.

Closings and other mitigation measures

Effective Wednesday, March 18, the following changes will occur at these Alexander County facilities to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus:

• All Alexander County parks, including Rocky Face Park, will be closed to the public.

• The Alexander County Senior Center will be closed to the public.

• Alexander County DSS Congregate Meal sites will be closed; however, meals will still be delivered.

• The Alexander County Library will be closed for customers; however, all three branches will be staffed to provide curbside book/movie delivery and utilization of the book drop at the back door. Due dates have been extended through April 1.

• The Alexander County Services Center will be closed to the public; however, tax payments can be made using the drive-thru and other departments can be contacted by phone for assistance.

• The Alexander County License Plate Agency will be limited to 10 clients at a time, per NCDOT restrictions.

• The Alexander County Cooperative Extension Center will have two people in the office each day on a rotating schedule, per guidance from the state. The center will continue farm and one-on-one visits while maintaining the recommended six-foot social distance at all times.

• No work-related out-of-county travel for Alexander County employees, with the exception of law enforcement and EMS.

• Signage will be placed on doors at county facilities to discourage those who are sick from entering.

• All North Carolina superior and district court proceedings will be postponed for at least 30 days, with some exceptions, effective March 16.

Alexander County staff is working to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for health, EMS, emergency management, law enforcement, and other employees who could potentially have contact with citizens who have contracted the virus.

On a state level, NC Governor Roy Cooper announced an executive order in response to COVID-19 that closes restaurants and bars for dine-in customers but allows them to continue takeout and delivery orders, effective at 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, March 17.

On March 10, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance advising against gatherings of 50 or more people. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on March 10 to provide access to state funding. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, which provides access to $50 billion for US states and territories. Since that time, the President has recommended avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people.

In North Carolina, 40 cases of COVID-19 have been reported with no deaths. In the United States, confirmed cases total 5,700 with 96 deaths; however, there has been a testing shortage coupled with the delay between testing and obtaining results, so officials believe the true figure could be higher. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 195,000 people with approximately 7,800 deaths.

How to protect yourself and others

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises citizens to: avoid close contact with people who are sick; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; stay home if you are sick; cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue; and clean/disinfect frequently touched surfaces or objects (tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc.). The agency also advises citizens to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. In addition, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and put a six-foot distance between yourself and other people (i.e. social distancing). Learn more at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html.

What to do if you are sick

If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have it, you should stay home as most people who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to recover at home. Wear a facemask when you are around other people. Do not leave, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas. Stay in touch with your doctor but call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you feel worse or you think it is an emergency. If you in a high-risk category (age 65+, underlying health issues, or immune-compromised), you should get tested for COVID-19 by making arrangements with the local health department, doctor’s office, or hospital.

What is COVID-19 and Coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illness in animals and humans. Human coronaviruses commonly circulate in the United States and usually cause mild illnesses like the common cold. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease that was identified in Wuhan, China, and is now spreading throughout the world.

Statement from the Alexander County Board of Commissioners

Alexander County declares State of Emergency for COVID-19 (Coronavirus)

On Tuesday, March 17, the Alexander County Board of Commissioners held an emergency meeting to discuss COVID-19 (coronavirus) and how the county could play a proactive role in helping contain the spread of this illness.

After much deliberation, the Board of Commissioners believed it would be in the best interest of Alexander County citizens, businesses, and employees to declare a State of Emergency.

Commissioners heard reports from Emergency Services, Health Department, Social Services, and Administration, as well as information from a conference call with the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners which provided updates from various state agencies.

While Alexander County currently has zero confirmed cases of COVID-19, the Board felt it would be a wise decision to be proactive and let our citizens know that we believe this could become a very serious health issue.

With this declaration, we believe that Alexander County is getting ahead of the game by increasing awareness of COVID-19, implementing facility closings, ensuring employee safety, and minimizing contact between people — all with the goal of ensuring the health, safety, and welfare of our citizens, and possibly saving lives.

The declaration also positions the county for potential state and federal funds if conditions worsen.

Please take this seriously. The magnitude of this virus and its effect on our county, state, nation, and world is not yet known, but together we will get through this potential crisis and emerge even stronger.

ELIZABETHTOWN — Bladen County has been declared in a State of Emergency, two county employee policies have been created, and publishing of delinquent tax listings was pushed back two months.

In an emergency meeting just shy of 90 minutes late Friday afternoon in Superior Courtroom No. 2 of the Bladen County Courthouse, county commissioners tasked themselves with receiving an update on COVID-19 and acting in response. There is yet to be a confirmed case of coronavirus in the county. All but one of the moves was approved 8-0; Commissioner Ashley Trivette had a work conflict and could not attend.

North Carolina has already been declared in a State of Emergency by Gov. Roy Cooper, and President Donald Trump had issued a declaration of national emergency. The county action enacts its Emergency Operations Plan, with mutual assistance compacts and agreements, and with protocol specific to Emergency Management, health and medical services departments of the county, and the Sheriff’s Office.

It also is a designation that potentially could have financial implications, specifically from FEMA — the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Dr. Terri Duncan and Nathan Dowless briefed commissioners at the outset. She’s the director of the Health Department and he’s the director of Emergency Management. Commissioners peppered them with questions and each was answered.

“There are a lot of rumors going around in the county,” Duncan said. “I ask you to remember to instill in people fact not fear.”

She said 12 people have been tested, and that includes tests of Bladen residents conducted in four other counties. There’s a four- to eight-day wait to get results, Duncan said.

“We appreciate your support to this point,” Duncan said. “We don’t know where we’re going in the next hour, but we are resilient people. We’ll make decisions on the current guidelines we have.”

Commissioners and the two directors emphasized how rapidly conditions change, including by the hour.

Dowless said there is a nationwide shortage of masks, isolation gowns and thermometers. He also pointed out a crucial fact for the county receiving assistance, such as when a hurricane hits. Usually there is help from other parts of the state and even the country; in this case, he said, “Everybody is experiencing this.”

He said 84 of 100 counties in the state had declared a State of Emergency; that list grew by at least one at the same time as Bladen acted when New Hanover County declared about 5 p.m.

Two forms of compassionate help are probable from Duke Energy and Star Communications. About $2,500 in gift cards from Duke is likely to be spread around the county, and seven to nine WiFi temporary hotspots are going to be established by Star to help students doing online learning while schools are closed. Star is also putting similar spots in Sampson County, where its headquarters are located.

More details on each will be forthcoming soon; Star may put the hotspots in as soon as Monday.

The county took action to suspend public access to all county buildings with the exception of the courthouse. It joins multiple Bladen municipalities that have already done so to include Elizabethtown, White Lake and Clarkton.

The panel passed policies titled “COVID-19 Temporary Teleworking Policy” and “COVID-19 Temporary Advanced Sick Leave Policy.” There was considerable discussion on each, with the work from home principle passing 8-0 and the sick leave action gaining approval 5-3.

Chairman Ray Britt, Vice Chairman David Gooden, Charles Ray Peterson, Daniel Dowless and Russell Priest were in favor, and Dr. Ophelia Munn-Goins, Michael Cogdell and Arthur Bullock were against.

Those opposed rejected the last line: “Following the exhaustion of advanced sick leave an employee may apply for leave without pay as provided in the Bladen County Personnel Policy.” The trio wanted it amended in some manner to say the county would revisit the situation if this happens because of the virus.

The voices of Britt and Peterson and the head-nods of others voting both in favor and against confirmed that the panel has every intention to, as more than one voice on opposite sides of the vote was heard to say, “take care of employees.”

The policy enables employees — and County Manager Greg Martin confirmed several dozen are new and without much accrued sick and vacation leave — to apply for advanced sick leave. There are five requirements.

The teleworking policy could potentially keep many county employees working. Its purpose is “to provide a means to continue necessary County business during a situation as authorized by the County Manager.”

In pushing back tax listings, Britt said he wanted to spare county residents making difficult financial choices as the virus ascends to its peak. Normally, the Bladen Journal publishes those listings before March 31. The new date must come before June 1, meaning latest publication would be Friday, May 29.

The board’s other action was to cancel meeting Monday, when a 5 p.m. special meeting was to address the fiscal budget for 2020-21 and a regular meeting was set for 6:30 p.m.

The board may meet in emergency session as the virus pandemic dictates; otherwise, the next scheduled regular meeting is April 6.

ASHEVILLE - Buncombe County has declared a local state of emergency in response to the global spread of new coronavirus COVID-19.

The county's board of commissioners was scheduled to consider the measure at its March 17 meeting, but board Chairman Brownie Newman said the morning of March 12 he had decided to take action sooner. He signed the declaration at the county's 2:30 p.m. media briefing on behalf of the entire board.

""I do have the authority to do it as commission chair,"" Newman told the Citizen Times that morning. ""I think we just want to be sending the message to the community that this is a very important health concern, there are definite things that individuals, businesses, local governments can do to reduce the risk of the spread of it.

""We want people to be taking all those reasonable steps now. We don't want to send the message that it's not something people should be very conscious of going forward.""

The declaration makes Buncombe eligible for state and federal resources that may be made available to communities to address the coronavirus, according to Newman. It enables all units of government in Buncombe too work together in the response.

Commissioners still to vote on virus-related budget amendment

County management proposed the declaration of a local state of emergency ""to ensure that COVID-19 remains controlled and that residents and visitors in Buncombe County remain safe and secure,"" a county memo states.

More on the local COVID-19 response:

County staff also suggested a budget amendment that would allow the county to allocate $250,000 from its fund balance for public health and human services costs ""in the event of necessary expenditures.""

Newman said commissioners will vote on the amendment March 17.

COVID-19: A global pandemic, tests out from WNC

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic March 11, as the WHO director general announced more than 100,000 cases of the respiratory illness in over 100 countries. The WHO reported early this month that the death rate for the virus was 3.4%.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on March 10, activating the Emergency Operations Center, which will help agencies coordinate their responses, according to a press release from Cooper's office.

A state of emergency also allows the state government to protect consumers from price gouging, increases county health departments' access to state funds and makes it easier to purchase essential medical supplies, the release said.

As of the afternoon of March 12, no confirmed cases of the virus had been reported in Buncombe County. During the county's media briefing, medical director Dr. Jennifer Mullendore said there are COVID-19 tests from WNC pending, but none had been returned with a presumed positive result.

Statewide, a total of 14 people had tested positive for COVID-19 as of that afternoon, according to a release from the Department of Health and Human Services and announcements from the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department.

Four of the five recently identified cases are a Forsyth County couple, a Johnston County resident and a Durham resident who tested positive in another state, the release said.

The fifth and sixth cases are in Mecklenburg County, according to the County's Department of Public Health.

Recommendations from officials

Dr. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, said at a press conference that people at high risk — those over the age of 65 or with underlying health conditions — should avoid large gatherings as much as possible, including church services, concerts and sporting events.

CLOSE Public officials urge precautions over coronavirus Wochit

In general, public officials have urged the public to take preventative measures similar to those taken to prevent the spread of the flu: wash hands for 20 seconds, including the top and bottom of hands and between fingers; cover coughs and sneezes; practice social distancing; try not to touch your own face and sanitize regularly touched surfaces.

If you think you have COVID-19, officials advise that you first call your doctor. If you do not have a doctor, call the Buncombe health department's communicable disease line at 828-250-5109.

Shortly after, the county declared a state of emergency.

A release from the county said the Chatham County Public Health Department was notified of the positive tests by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. To protect the privacy of the residents, no further information about the individuals will be shared by the health department.

“As testing for the new coronavirus ramps up, we are expecting to see more cases,” said Chatham County Public Health Director Layton Long. “We urge residents to stay vigilant and follow the guidance of local, state and national public health officials.”

The Board of Chatham County Commissioners declared a state of emergency shortly after the release about the new cases was shared. The declaration follows Orange County and the state of North Carolina making the same decision.

“This proactive step by the [Board of Commissioners] to activate the County’s Emergency Operations Plan,” said Chatham County Manager Dan LaMontagne in a statement, “allows for reallocation of staff and authorizes the County Manager to take all necessary actions to protect lives and property, and to ensure safety and public order.”

The first case discovered in Chatham County was the second case identified in North Carolina. The resident had traveled to Italy in late February and experienced flu-like symptoms.

The total number of identified cases in North Carolina as of Tuesday afternoon is 40, according to state health officials.

At this time, the State of Emergency stipulates expectations of County staff. There are no further restrictions, such as a curfew or prohibiting the sale of alcohol, being placed on the community.

The declaration, signed by Ronald Gatling, chairman of the Hertford County Commissioners, says, in part, “control measures could be place in effect immediately to implement plans for the prevention of, preparation for, response to and recovery from any and all emergency situations that may result from the impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic. These control measures will be coordinated with federal, state and local agencies for the orderly protection, treatment, and rehabilitation of affected persons.”

Hertford County officials said as of 5 pm on Thursday there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the county.

The State of Emergency will remain in place until rescinded.

Friday morning, Hertford County Emergency Management Director Chris Smith sent out a spreadsheet that listed local priorities, to include protecting public health – especially those of the most vulnerable populations (the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions); minimizing public disruption to the extent possible while also preventing future spread of COVID-19; and continue to provide essential public health services and essential governmental services.

On Friday afternoon, North Carolina officials – to include Emergency Management and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) – conducted an online press conference.

Information gained from that conference included there were 137 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 38 counties. There is one confirmed case of “community transmission” – meaning the person had not traveled to a known area of infection.

It was noted that all 115 public school districts statewide are serving meals to schoolchildren, either by pick-up or some method of delivery.

Childcare facilities across the state are weighing their options to remain open. The state has sent those facilities a list of safety guidelines to follow as it relates to COVID-19, to include proper sanitization/disinfection methods.

As of Friday, there is no state mandated order for North Carolina residents to shelter in place, nor is there an order to close non-essential businesses.

Mike Sprayberry, Director of North Carolina Emergency Management, encouraged state residents not to purchase items in excess.

“Our grocery stores/supermarkets are open and our supply chain is not broken,” Sprayberry said. “There is a lot of bad information out there, especially on social media. I would recommend for all of our citizens to get their information from a trusted source, to include DHHS and the CDC (Centers for Disease Control).”

“Declaring a State of Emergency means we are opening the door for federal and state resources and our ability to acquire them, shall we need them. This State of Emergency does not include other restrictions at this time. Due to the ever-evolving changes with this virus, Craven County will continue to monitor and adjust this declaration as necessary,” stated Jack B. Veit, III, Craven County Manager.

A State of Emergency speeds up supplies, allows for budget flexibility, allows for the redirection of staff to COVID-19 related tasks, and protects consumers from price gouging.

Earlier today, President Donald Trump said he is hoping the United States will be reopened by Easter as he weighs how to relax nationwide social-distancing guidelines to put some workers back on the job during the coronavirus outbreak.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 as Congress and the White House neared a deal on Tuesday to inject nearly $2 trillion of aid into an economy ravaged by the coronavirus.

FORSYTH COUNTY, N.C. -- Forsyth County has declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus.

County officials released a statement, saying:

""In conjunction with the President’s and the Governor’s declarations of state of emergency pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, Forsyth County, North Carolina, has declared a state of emergency effective March 13, 2020. This emergency declaration allows the county to claim and receive reimbursement for labor, supplies, and materials associated with its COVID-19 response. No civil restrictions are imposed in the declaration, but the County has the ability to impose restrictions if the need arises.""

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday afternoon, citing coronavirus concerns.

There are currently 1,920 official cases of COVID-19 in the US and 41 confirmed deaths.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Trump administration are laboring to finish agreement on a coronavirus aid package.

Pelosi held a news conference Friday to outline the Families First Coronavirus Response Act in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

House Democrats are expected to push the bill through Friday that focuses on help for the American family.

""The three most important parts of this bill are testing, testing, testing,"" said Pelosi.

""This legislation facilitates free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We can only defeat this outbreak if we have an accurate determination of its scale and scope so that we can pursue the precise science-based response that is necessary.""

One major hang-up between Democrats and Republicans was reportedly the paid family and medical leave provision, with Republicans pushing to structure it in a way that it could be implemented quickly and avoid undue burdens on employers.

By Friday morning that issue had appeared largely resolved with the administration, but there seemed to be lingering concerns among House Republicans.

The coronavirus aid package will also give USDA authority to allow states to provide emergency food stamp assistance to families whose children could miss out on free or reduced-price meals if schools are closed.

Under the current proposal, the child’s school must be closed for no less than five consecutive days for families to be eligible.

Pelosi's comments come less than an hour from President Donald Trump expected further response to coronavirus.

Worldwide, 137,000 people have been infected and more than 5,000 have died, but half of those who had the virus have already recovered.

Most patients have mild or moderate symptoms such as a fever or cold, but severe symptoms including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems.

The gathering at the Gaston County Courthouse brought together officials representing law enforcement, the school system, the court system and the local hospital to address efforts to deal with the pandemic within this area. It came as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose to 32 across the state, and four in nearby Mecklenburg County.

Chris Dobbins, director of the Gaston County Department of Health and Human Services, said no positive cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed here. But he warned against putting too much emphasis on that.

""That should not give anyone a false sense of security,"" he said. ""There’s a very high probability that we have the virus in our community.""

As part of the declaration, the county is restricting all public or social gatherings to 50 people or less. Gaston County Police Chief Joe Ramey said they will have the ability to charge and prosecute violators, though he urged residents to self-police for the good of the community.

Courts in will remain open on a limited basis, as the majority of district and superior courts across the state will be closed for 30 days. Gaston County District Court Judge John Greenlee said two courtrooms will be running consistently during normal business hours to handle certain matters, and judges will be available, though jury trials that have yet to begin will be suspended for 30 days.

Anyone with questions about the court schedule is advised to call 704-852-3100.

""This is unprecedented in the state of North Carolina, and certainly in Gaston County,"" Greenlee said.

Gov. Roy Cooper on Saturday ordered all K-12 public schools across the state to close for two weeks. Gaston County Schools Superintendent Jeff Booker said local officials are developing packets of information to send home with the roughly 31,000 students in the local system, so that learning can continue. He also unveiled a plan to provide meals for the 65 percent of the student population that receives some form of food assistance.

""We’ve already begun a plan to activate our summer feeding program on Tuesday,"" he said.

‘We must be proactive’

Gaston County Commission Chairman Tracy Philbeck said the restriction on gatherings does not apply to licensed businesses, healthcare facilities, schools, government offices and daycares.

""Employers are encouraged to allow employees to work from home, stagger work schedules and implement in-person work space arrangements that optimize work space between employees,"" he said. ""The reason we have chosen to decrease the size of public and social gatherings is based on specific community needs. Based on the information from our health care officials and surveying critical public services, a spike in confirmed cases has the potential to put in jeopardy our ability to handle patients, and keep essential public services operating efficiently and effectively to address our community needs.""

Philbeck said the declaration will allow the county to take advantage of possible state and federal funding and allow its operations center and municipalities to operate in an efficient fashion to address the coronavirus. He said the county is determined to stay ahead of the game in this situation.

""We cannot afford to wait and see what happens. That is not responsible leadership,"" he said. ""We must be proactive, and when we get through this crisis – and we will – I will be fine looking back and saying we did too much. I refuse to look back and say we did not do enough.""

Dr. Todd Davis, chief medical officer of CaroMont Health, said the leadership team at CaroMont Regional Medical Center has been planning extensively since January for the possible arrival of the coronavirus. They have done that by collaborating with everyone from public health officials to paramedics.

""We have created a tiered response, allowing us to be able to react to the needs of the patient volume we potentially could have,"" he said. ""I’m extremely confident our health care providers will show the type of professionalism and compassion you expect from them, and we will do everything to make sure our patients and our staff are safe.""

‘Social caring’

People who are young and healthy may not be as susceptible to COVID-19, but they can still be carriers of the virus who could spread it to people who are more at risk, such as older residents and people with weakened immune systems, Dobbins said.

""You may have heard the term ‘social distancing’ a lot in previous days,"" he said. ""What I would like you to think about is another term: ‘social caring.’ Because that’s where we are going to need this community to go moving forward. We’ve got the expertise, we’ve got the resources, we’ve got the support. Now is an opportunity for us to help each other.""

Philbeck encouraged residents to stay away from crowds, practice proper hygiene and call before attending any type of function. That will help to protect people in the community who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, including senior citizens, those already under a doctor’s care, those with underlying health issues, and health care workers, he said.

Rather than asking churches to close, Philbeck said they are requesting that they keep gatherings to 50 people or less, possibly by holding multiple services throughout the day. Not taking the county’s recommendations seriously could have horrible effects, he said.

""If we have a small spike in coronavirus cases in Gaston County, I’m thinking 10 or 15, it could literally put our jail in jeopardy, our hospital in jeopardy, and our health and human services.

""We could literally have to decide who gets a respirator and who doesn’t. It’s that serious.""

Dobbins said they do not yet have the ability to test ""anybody and everybody"" who wants to know if they have the virus. But people who have questions or concerns are being urged to call the county’s community hotline, at 704-862-5303. It’s operational from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays.

""We do anticipate the calls are going to increase and we are looking at expanding those hours,"" he said.

Plan for the court system

The state constitution mandates that courts must remain open at all times. But North Carolina Chief Justice Cheri Beasley’s decision on Friday to issue an emergency declaration for courts across the state means that they will only be open on a limited basis for the next 30 days, Greenlee said.

""There are some things we cannot continue for 30 days,"" he said.

One courtroom at the local courthouse will operate normally and handle things such as domestic violence protective orders, no contact/harassment/stalking orders, and allow inmates to have their bonds reviewed and make first appearances. A second courtroom will be open to handle all other emergency matters, and fulfill the constitution by allowing for due process, Greenlee said.

Jury trials will be suspended for 30 days, though a sole jury trial that is currently in panel in Gaston County will continue, possibly being wrapped up by early next week, Greenlee said. The grand jury has also been suspended.

The Gaston County Courthouse will remain open, and the clerks’ office will continue to accept filings. But Greenlee said residents should only come there if they absolutely have to.

""I ask all citizens who have cases scheduled in district court over the next 30 days, up until April 16, do not come to the courthouse to come to your court date,"" he said. ""Between the clerk’s office and the DA’s office, there will a concerted effort next week to get court dates on every case that’s scheduled for the next 30 days. That’s thousands.""

Anyone with a domestic violence protective order should come to court as scheduled, Greenlee said. But most other residents should wait to get a notice in the next 10 days regarding when their court date has been rescheduled.

""If you have a civil or domestic case, contact your attorney or the clerk’s office and they’ll give you the procedure on how to get a new court date set,"" he said.

School system response

Booker said the governor’s decision to close schools for two weeks will have ""a drastic impact on Gaston County."" He thanked students, parents and employees for their patience and understanding to this point.

Staff have been told to report for a teacher workday on Monday, where more will be discussed about the week and month ahead.

Booker said information will be disseminated to parents and employees in the same way that it is done for inclement weather, and the school system’s website will be updated continuously.

""For our students, we are developing packets of information we can give you so that learning can go on,"" he said. ""But let me stress that nothing can replace the value of our highly qualified teachers. We will do the best, and we will work to make things available, recognizing that 65 percent of our population receives some form of assistance with food.""

Booker said they have selected 10 sites that they plan to use as distribution points in activating the summer feeding program Tuesday. More details were being worked out on that plan Sunday afternoon, but he emphasized plans could change quickly.

""The governor may come out with a different plan,"" he said. ""Things are evolving and as the state empowers and asks us to do things, we will respond.""

Booker said they have been talking with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction and internet providers about the potential for some type of online learning.

""What we know is that we do not have unlimited internet availability for 31,000 of our students,"" he said. ""That is the purpose of introducing learning packets, so we can utilize them in the interim. Measures are being taken to talk to some of the major providers about providing free access, but that will take some time.""

GUILFORD COUNTY, N.C. -- Guilford County officials have released an amended State of Emergency Declaration that prohibits gatherings to no more than 10 people.

The tighter restrictions go into effect on Wednesday at 5 p.m.

Chairman of the Board Jeff Phillips announced in a recorded statement that as of this week Guilford County identified its first case of community spread, which is a COVID-19 positive test with no connection to recent travel or another COVID-19 case.

""We are now entering a challenging phase in a rapidly changing situation. We need every member of our community to follow the CDC recommendations, to cover their sneeze and cough, to stay home when sick, to wash their hands frequently and reduce social interactions,"" Phillips said in a statement.

The Harnett County Board of Commissioners added their jurisdiction to the growing list of towns, counties and states declaring a state of emergency.

The action came at the conclusion of the board of commissioners meeting Monday night in Lillington.

Board Chairman Howard Penny issued a statement before reading a proclamation that became effective at 8 p.m. on March 16.

“We understand that many of our residents are concerned about the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus across the United States of America, the State of North Carolina and within Harnett County,” Penny said reading from a prepared statement. “While the threat of this pandemic is very real, please know that county officials — including the Harnett County Health Department and Harnett County Emergency Management — have been actively preparing for potential impacts from this coronavirus and are staying on top of new developments.”

In the statement, Penny said the board understands the concerns of citizens over the COVID-19 virus and urged residents not to panic.

“We ask that citizens remain calm and continue following the guidelines established by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control during this event,” Penny said. “These guidelines are in place for your safety and those of your fellow residents. The more people adhere to these guidelines, the sooner the coronavirus threat will pass.”

Penny also tried to reassure residents not to panic as the number of cases, which has grown to four as of Tuesday morning, in Harnett County rise. He said despite the measures currently in place to reduce the risk, the chances are there will be more positive tests.

“Even with these measures in place, it is reasonable to anticipate that Harnett County will see additional positive tests,” Penny said. “This should not be cause for panic. The health and well-being of our citizens is the top priority of the Harnett County Board of Commissioners and county staff.”

Benson

In addition to Harnett County’s declaration, the town board of commissioners of Benson also issued a declaration during a special session Monday night.

Benson Media Coordinator Tyler Douglas said the move will allow the town manager and police chief to implement certain actions.

“This will also allow the town manager and the police chief to augment building access, implement safety measures, and institute a curfew if necessary in relation to keeping staff and residents safe from the spread of the virus,” Douglas said. “Currently, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 in Benson, but due to reports of the virus in neighboring areas, Benson commissioners felt compelled to take every available measure to ensure the safety of town employees and residents.”

At the present time, the Benson Town Hall remains open and operating under normal business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. However, the majority of the building is closed to the public. Residents can still use the main door, go up the stairs and pay utility bills. The main hallway offices, planning office and downstairs offices are closed and locked.

On Friday, town officials announced all after-hours events at Parks & Recreation, the W.J. Barefoot Auditorium, Lee Street Gymnasium, Town Hall Conference Center facilities, and Singing Grove will be postponed or canceled for 30 days. The Benson Museum is also closed for the next 30 days, as is the Mary Duncan Public Library.

Dunn

Mayor William Elmore signed a proclamation Monday, declaring a state of emergency in Dunn, effective at noon and to last until the order is rescinded or modified.

“On March 13, 2020, President Donald Trump declared a National Emergency and the first case was confirmed in Harnett County,” the mayor noted in his proclamation. “Declaring a state of emergency is necessary to allow for sufficient personnel and resources to maintain order and protect public health, safety and welfare and to secure property in the city of Dunn.”

The declaration orders city staff to work with county, state and federal agencies “for the orderly protection, treatment and rehabilitation of affected persons; and to provide for cooperation and coordination of activities relating to emergency mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.”

Johnston County

According to a statement from the Johnston County Board of Commissioners Chairman Ted Godwin, the order became effective at 8 a.m. Monday morning. Godwin said the declaration is necessary to position the county to receive needed aid from state and federal resources.

“I have today initiated a proclamation for a state of emergency in Johnston County primarily because of procedural and logistical requirements for expedited assistance from state and federal agencies,” Godwin said in the statement. “Our team feels that this declaration will strategically position our local emergency management personnel to receive necessary equipment and supplies more quickly.”

There are currently two cases of COVID-19 in Johnston County, according to county officials. The two cases involve people in the same household and are two of the over 30 cases currently reported statewide.

“Our board members, along with all elected leaders in Johnston County, consider the health and well-being of our citizens to be our top priority,” Godwin said. “Johnston County citizens have always pulled together in difficult times. I feel confident that with diligence, good faith and open communications, we can weather this crisis as well.”

Angier

In its declaration, Angier town officials, which include Mayor Bob Smith and Town Manager Gerry Vincent, the town urged residents to avoid large meetings as much as possible and to limit visits to town offices.

“By declaring a state of emergency for the town of Angier we are urging residents from attending any large gatherings,” the statement said. “We are also encouraging anyone that has business with the town to limit face-to-face contact with staff, therefore we are urging our residents to pay their water bills online, by phone or utilizing our drop box.”

The town is also urging local organizations to follow similar guidelines.

“We are encouraging all local organizations that are planning large group activities to either postpone them to a later date or cancel them,” the statement said. “This is not limited just to civic clubs and organizations, but also restaurants, grocery stores and churches.”

In addition to requesting bills be paid remotely, the town announced all recreational activities sponsored by the parks and recreation department are canceled until further notice.

Town officials also said town hall will continue with normal business hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, but the library will be operating on shorter hours. It will be open Monday through Friday from 9 to 11 a.m. and from 3 to 5 p.m. and the Depot will be closed until further notice.

Cumberland County

Cumberland County Board of Commissioners Chairman Marshall Faircloth Monday, March 16, declared a state of emergency in response to COVID-19. There are currently no presumptive or confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 in Cumberland County.

“Although we do not have a positive case of the infection right now in Cumberland County, we are preparing for that day and this is a proactive measure to ensure we have the flexibility and resources needed,” Faircloth said during a press conference. The declaration will activate the county’s Emergency Operations Center for as long as required and authorize the county to take appropriate action to protect the public welfare.

“This may mean alterations in county services and programs. We will keep the public updated on any changes though the COVID-19 webpage on our website at co.cumberland.nc.us and our social media platforms,” Faircloth said.

What it means

Under a state of emergency, access to state and federal assistance is made easier and, in the case of the Johnston County order, it outlines and fights price gouging.

The Johnston County order said gouging is punishable by a fine of up to $500 per incident and 30 days in jail, and each sale shall constitute a separate offense.

The State of Emergency is effective as of 5 p.m. and applies to the unincorporated areas of the county, City of Wilmington, and all beach communities.

The State of Emergency states:

“The State of Emergency provides consistency across all of New Hanover County and promotes social distancing to help protect us each individually, as well as others,” said New Hanover County Board of Commissioners Chair Julia Olson-Boseman. “We know limiting gatherings and beach access can be inconvenient for our community, but it is an important step to keep our residents safe. We are being proactive so that we don’t have to close other facilities or important services in our community, and we need people to take this order seriously. The more we can do now to limit the spread of this virus, the better.”

Bridges are still open, and businesses on the islands will continue to operate, abiding by the current Governor’s orders. Only public access to the beach strands is prohibited at this time. Residents are encouraged to support local businesses by using online services, purchasing gift cards and ordering takeout or delivery.

The county will also close public restrooms at all county parks until further notice. This is due to the higher level and frequency of cleaning and sanitation recommended for high volume public restrooms to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The county’s parks and gardens remain open, but visitors cannot congregate in groups of more than 10 and must maintain a distance of six feet from one another.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, residents are encouraged to continue increased prevention measures and practice limited contact with others:

Follow social distancing: gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, under the State of Emergency, and individuals are encouraged to maintain 6 feet of distance from others.

Wash hands frequently with soap and water, and for at least 20 seconds each time.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid close contact with people who are ill.

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.

Do not reuse tissue after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose.

Clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched (like your phone, tablet, countertops and daily work surfaces).

Stay home and away from others when you are sick.

Board of Commissioners Chairman Jack Bright said the county wants to be proactive and have plans in place and the situation continues to evolve as cases of COVID-19 increase in the United States and North Carolina.

""This is unchartered territory. We don’t have a playbook to go by and have to take it a day at a time and be proactive,"" Bright said after the special meeting held Wednesday afternoon to consider the resolution approving the State of Emergency.

At this time there has been only one positive case of COVID-19 reported in Onslow County but they don’t know what lies ahead as ""dozens"" of other Onslow citizens have pending test results, said County Manager Sharon Russell.

""We have received back (Wednesday) about 10 negative tests but we have dozens of tests from our citizens of Onslow County that are outstanding at this point,"" Russell said. ""We have no way of foreseeing into the future to know if we will get 1 or 2 more new cases or if we could get dozens of new cases over the next few days.""

Russell said the State of Emergency doesn’t set restrictions on citizens but puts in place measures that will allow the county to respond more effectively.

""As this situation has changed we’re trying to be careful and protect the safety and health of our citizens without reacting in a way that causes unnecessary disruption,"" Russell said.

Having the State of Emergency in place will allow the county to seek grants and reimbursement from the federal government for eligible expenses related to the response to coronavirus pandemic, such as overtime for county employees and additional supplies that may be needed for first responders and various other employees for protective and other gear.

Emergency Services Director Norman Bryson noted after the meeting that the call center opened to answer questions from citizens is open 12 hours a day and requires 9 hours of overtime each day to keep the call center manned by county employees.

As of the time of the special meeting, 19 counties had at least one confirmed positive case of COVID-19. Of those, Onslow County was one of four that had not yet adopted a State of Emergency, Russell said.

With adoption of the resolution, Onslow County’s declaration of a State of Emergency applies to the unincorporated area of Onslow County.

LUMBERTON — The Robeson County Department of Health announced it has coronavirus test kits on Tuesday, the same day the governor declared a state of emergency related to the new virus.

“Each health department in North Carolina was allowed three kits for testing through the state lab,” said Bill Smith, county Health Department director.

Only people who have been in direct contact with a person known to be infected with COVID-19 or are exhibiting symptoms of the virus, and flu has been ruled out, will be tested, Smith said. Commercial labs, such as Lab Corps, are available for private use.

“As tests become more available, I would expect testing parameters to loosen,” Smith said.

Gov. Roy Cooper’s emergency declaration activates the Emergency Operations Center to help agencies coordinate virus response activities from one location and to make it easier to buy needed medical supplies, protect consumers from price gouging, and increase county health departments’ access to state funds.

“The health and safety of North Carolinians is our top priority,” Cooper said. “We are taking the necessary steps to ensure that North Carolina is prepared and responding to this virus, and this order helps us do that. Though we are still in the early stages in North Carolina, time is a valuable resource and we must work together to slow the spread while we can.”

The order has key provisions similar to those enacted in the wake of a natural disaster. The order will help with the costs associated with combating the disease and help make available supplies that may be difficult for health-care providers and public health agencies to get because of increased demand. It also increases the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Service’s role in supporting local health departments, which have been tasked with monitoring quarantines, tracing exposure and administering testing.

“The emergency declaration really just helps focus on the issue,” Smith said. “It did not put any restrictions in place, but rather reinforced actions to counter the spread of the virus and limit exposure to the vulnerable population.”

The activation of the Emergency Operations Center will help with communication among agencies involved in fighting the virus’ spread, he said.

“What it does not do is have the state issue decrees of no mass gatherings, no sporting events, no church activities, etc. — things that Italy has done because the virus is so pervasive,” Smith said. “If we don’t get it under control, that could be the next step.”

Some states with fewer COVID-19 cases have issued similar emergency declarations, Smith said.

“The governor seems to be of the adage ‘better safe than sorry,’ which is in keeping with pronouncements made early during adverse weather storms,” Smith said.

Also on Tuesday, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services issued recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the number of people infected. The recommendations come in the wake of the state health department confirming on Monday five new cases of COVID-19 in Wake County, bringing the statewide total to seven.

There are no cases of COVID-19 in Robeson County, according to Smith.

“We understand these actions will have a significant impact on the lives of people in our communities,” a Department of Health and Human Services press release reads in part. “NCDHHS is making these recommendations based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, current actions by other states, and the most up-to-date epidemiologic information we have to protect the public’s health.”

The Department of Health and Human Services recommends people at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid large groups of people as much as possible. This includes gatherings, such as concert venues, conventions, church services, sporting events, and crowded social events. People at high risk should also avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel.

People at high risk include anyone more than 65 years of age, or having an underlying health condition, such as heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes, or a weakened immune system.

All facilities that serve as residential establishments for high-risk people are urged to restrict visitors. These establishments include nursing homes, independent and assisted living facilities, correctional facilities, and facilities that care for medically vulnerable children.

The Department of Health and Human Services recommends that event organizers urge anyone who is sick to not attend, encourage people who are at high risk to not attend, adopt lenient refund policies for people who are high risk, find ways to give people more physical space so as to limit close contact as much as possible, encourage attendees to wash hands frequently, and to clean surfaces with standard cleaners.

All travelers returning from countries and U.S. states affected by COVID-19 are urged to follow Department of Health and Human Services guidance on self-monitoring: https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-response-north-carolina/coronavirus.

The Department of Health and Human Services is not recommending the pre-emptive closure of schools and childcare centers at this time.

The recommendations should begin immediately and extend through March 31, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Smith favors the recommendations because they, for the most part, are designed to protect the vulnerable, older population.

“It also recognizes that a person coming from a state, say Washington, may be as much of a risk as Italy, Japan or such,” he said. “There is a special emphasis on restricting visitors around facility-bound individuals which is keeping with restrictions put in place at the height of the flu season.

“It should be noted that industries, county and city governments, school boards or any employer can be more restrictive than state guidelines.”

The CDC reported Tuesday there are more than 110,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide. There are 647 cases in the United States and there have been 25 deaths, according to the CDC. Cases have been confirmed in 35 states and in Washington, D.C.

A North Carolina Division of Public Health report issued Tuesday put the number of global cases at 113,702 and the number deaths around the world at 4,012.

Debate rages among health officials, physicians and researchers about how contagious and deadly the new coronavirus is. Most say this is because too little is known about the disease that came out of Wuhan, China, and was first reported to the World Health Organization in late December.

In particular, estimates of the virus’ mortality rate vary widely. The World Health Organization reported Friday the mortality rate could be between 3% and 4%. The same WHO report said that estimate was based on the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases.

Some researchers, in particular a group in the United Kingdom, say the morality rate could be 2% or lower because some cases, particularly mild cases, are not reported. Some researchers believe between five and 40 coronavirus cases in 1,000 will result in death, with a best guess of nine in 1,000, or about 1%.

Some researchers and public health officials agree that death from COVID-19 will depend greatly on the infected person’s age, sex, general health and the health system available to the person.

Surry County is now under a state of emergency as county leaders look for ways to keep their coronavirus numbers down. The county is one of the North Carolina counties without a confirmed case of the coronavirus. The county manager said the state of emergency doesn't mean travel will be restricted in or out of the county. The state of emergency basically gives any town in the county more power to receive more resources and be reimbursed later from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Some examples would be fuel or items in the home you might need. ""It’s not a typical situation. I don’t have a playbook for this. We’ve had to be patient in what we do when making decisions and we’ve had to change those decisions on the fly,"" County Manager, Chris Knopf said.The Surry County Health Department is now monitoring the latest updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as this situation evolves. Samantha Ange, the county health director, said there is so much false information online right now. She wants people to know that North Carolina Health and Human Services and the CDC have updates daily. ""I think that going through a pandemic will definitely stay in all of our minds throughout our lifetime. But if we do, we know how to better react. I think we'll tell our children about this one day,"" Ange said. While Surry County has no confirmed cases now, leaders are trying to learn from other counties or towns to figure out the best move to make next.",73050,2020-03-21

We encourage you to support our efforts to keep the public informed by subscribing at https://www.transylvaniatimes.com/subscribe.

Transylvania County has just declared, at roughly 1:30 p.m., Friday, an ""official State of Emergency.""

The following comes from Commission Board Chairman Mike Hawkins: Today I am declaring an official State of Emergency for Transylvania County. It is important to understand what that means and, just as importantly, what that doesn't mean.

A State of Emergency is a tool which gives government some flexibility in responding to unusual circumstances. I believe this is merited in our current COVID-19 response execution, due to the complexity of the response planning which is taking place.

In declaring a State of Emergency, Transylvania County joins 67 other North Carolina counties, along with the Federal and State governments. All those entities decided this action was a prudent part of their COVID-19 response planning.

This action is also coming with the assent of the City of Brevard and town of Rosman.

These are important points to understand. There is no reason for additional concern on behalf of our citizens. This is a case of adding an additional tool in our toolbox, should it be needed.

On behalf of the Transylvania County Board of Commissioners and the dedicated staff of Transylvania County government, thank you for your response to this challenge. The outpouring of initiatives from the government, business, non-profit and faith communities has been inspirational. We have no doubt the bonds we are building will remain long afer COVID-19 disappears.

Thank you for all that you do.",32903,2020-03-21

The county’s move falls short of ordering residents to shelter-in-place, but officials in Raleigh and other towns hinted Sunday that level of restriction may be coming.

“We don’t want to overreact, but we want to stay on top of things,” Wake Commissioner James West said Sunday. “We possibly could have to take on more restrictions because there’s just so many unknown factors in terms of the spread. ... We don’t want to create panic.”

The county’s declaration makes the following mandatory:

Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal

▪ Mass gatherings are limited to 50 people, whether in theaters, meeting halls, auditoriums or any other indoor spaces. Many types of businesses are excluded, including grocery and hardware stores, gas stations, hotels and day cares.

▪ Fitness clubs, gyms, salons, tattoo parlors and spas are closed. Restaurants may remain open for delivery and carry-out.

“None of these decisions is easy,” County Manager David Ellis said. “The risk of keeping non-essential business open is too great.”

▪ The use of playground equipment, both public and private, is prohibited. Open space around parks and greenways can remain open.

“We want people to use our greenways, our trails, to get that fresh air,” county Director of Human Services Regina Petteway said. “That’s good for their mental health.”

▪ Nursing home and assisted living visits are limited to adults who show identification, and all must show identification and be screened for signs of COVID-19. Visits are confined to residents’ rooms and limited to one person a day.

▪ The county is urging businesses to start respiratory and temperature screening for employees and to prohibit people with fevers higher than 100.4 from entering. Businesses are also encouraged to screen clients.

Some towns, including Cary and Morrisville, have also declared an emergency state, but the Board of Commissioners’ Sunday declaration makes the restrictions uniform countywide.

Ellis said police and sheriff’s deputies will enforce the new restrictions but the details, including whether tickets will be issued, is up to individual cities and towns.

Wake County Emergency Operations Center Director Darshan Patel said stricter rules such as shelter-in-place is “a tool in the toolbox” that could kick in if the county sees continued spread of the virus. But for now the idea is to give enhanced social distancing time to work.

The state DHHS reported 255 positive tests for coronavirus Sunday morning, rising from 184 on Saturday. Testing has increased to 6,438 people, up from 5,276 Saturday.

The News & Observer has compiled a separate tally based on reporting from both the state and individual counties. By Sunday afternoon, the total cases had reached 298, of which 49 are in Wake County.",1072203,NA

(NewsDakota.com) – The City of Valley City and Barnes County passed a resolution declaring an emergency in response to the COVID-19 virus.

The declaration gives the city and the county access to potential funding if any damages were to come from the global pandemic.

Valley City Mayor Dave Carlsrud talked about the importance of declaring the emergency and the precautionary steps everyone should take during this health emergency.

City Attorney Carl Martineck said the city commission decided to close access to city hall to protect staff members from contracting the virus. He also talked about a new directive from the North Dakota Attorney General’s Office concerning public meetings during this health emergency.

Barnes County Officials continue to monitor the COVID-19 activity, and Barnes County Departments have been undergoing efforts to mitigate activity through employee education, and reviewing continuity of services. An Emergency Declaration allows for utilization of the County’s emergency reserve fund to assist with expenditures related to this health emergency.

Barnes County is committed to providing services for the community. Real-time adjustments regarding our County’s business conduct will be made in accordance with the ND Department of Health recommendations and publicized accordingly and that officials of Barnes County will strive to maintain a level of preparedness to ensure services and mitigate the spread of the virus.

"324","North Dakota","LaMoure","https://www.jamestownsun.com/news/weather/4722753-LaMoure-County-declares-flood-emergency","LaMoure County declares flood emergency","LaMoure County and the city of LaMoure declared flood emergencies on Tuesday, Oct. 15, due to the possibility of high water releases from Jamestown and Pipestem dams. The declaration comes after Jamestown Mayor Dwaine Heinrich issued an emergency declaration during a special City Council meeting on Monday, Oct. 14.

""There are potential agricultural impacts but there are also other impacts that could affect both the county and the city of LaMoure,"" said Kimberly Robbins, LaMoure County emergency manager. ""The best case scenario, the releases decrease. The worst case scenario, we see again what we went through last spring.""

Water levels of the James River in the city of LaMoure were at 15.9 feet on April 4 of this year due to ice jams and high tributary flows.

As of 1:15 p.m. on Oct. 15, the gauge of the James River in the city of LaMoure was 11.8 feet. According to the LaMoure County website, the average level is 7 to 8 feet, with the action stage being at 12 feet. Flood stage is 14 feet, a moderate flood stage is 16 feet and a major flood stage is 18 feet.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is releasing 1,000 cubic feet per second from Jamestown Dam and 800 cfs from Pipestem Dam as of Monday for a combined flow of 1,800 cfs, said Jerry Bergquist, Stutsman County emergency manager.

listen live watch live

Bergquist said the 1,800 cfs being released from the two dams is the highest it has been since 2011, when releases were a combined 2,400 cfs.

Robbins said it takes between five and seven days for water released from Pipestem and Jamestown dams to reach LaMoure. Bergquist said since mid-September, Pipestem and Jamestown reservoirs have experienced a high volume of water in both river systems from high precipitation.

""I don't know if I have any (expectations) yet,"" Bergquist said. ""Based on everything we know now it isn't anything different than what we knew about it yesterday.""

A public information meeting is scheduled for Wednesday at City Hall in Jamestown, where representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Weather Service, city of Jamestown and Stutsman County Emergency Management are among those expected to attend.

Bergquist said the meeting could reveal what the next step for both counties is.

""We’re putting together a plan to do some minimal sandbagging in some parts of town where we know elevation is low,"" Bergquist said. ""If we don’t end up using the (sandbagging) operation that would be the best news in the world, but we’d at least be prepared for it if we did need to use it.”

Robbins said LaMoure County will be installing a new gauge in the river to measure the flow and elevation of the water. The gauge will be near Adrian, about 30 miles northwest of the city of LaMoure, where a second gauge is located.

""The county website is being updated with flood information constantly,"" Robbins said. ""Hopefully our residents will be informed of what flood stages we will be entering going forward.""

Bergquist said time is going to be very valuable moving forward.

“We're trying to be as proactive as we can,"" Berquist said. ""We know they're going to want to release as much water as possible before the freeze-up.”



Bergquist also said saturated soils combining with no frost on the ground could be a potential problem for people living close to the river.

""People that are close to the river may be experiencing higher water tables,"" Bergquist said. ""Some (sump) pumps might be kicking in and starting to work, but others might not. There's no better time to check your sump pumps.""

Sump pumps are commonly found in basements where homes are at or below the water table and work to pump groundwater outside of the home automatically, Bergquist said. If the water level is high enough and the pumps aren't working, people can start to see flooding in their basement.

""Seriously, it is a great time to check your pumps,"" Bergquist said. ""It is a very wise thing to do just to check and make sure.""

Bergquist said LaMoure may be the only town ""highly impacted"" by unregulated tributaries adding to the two rivers flowing south from Jamestown.

""LaMoure is affected more than anywhere,"" Bergquist said. ""There could easily be homes along the river where the water might be getting closer. I don't know of any hot spots in particular except for the city of LaMoure.""

Bergquist said northern parts of South Dakota could see increases in water levels up until the James River connects with the Missouri River.

""When you get into South Dakota, there gets to be a lot of issues there as well,"" Bergquist said. ""The river has a tendency to spread out quite a bit. Maybe even a half mile or more.""

The public information meeting will begin at 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 16 at City Hall, 102 3rd Ave. SE, in Jamestown.",4166,NA

Batavia, Ohio – The Board of Commissioners today declared a State of Emergency in Clermont County in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The action came in a room reconfigured to achieve social distancing to help prevent the spread of the virus. Those who had business to conduct with the board waited in a conference room with a video feed and came into the session individually to speak.

“Extraordinary times require extraordinary action,” said David Painter, president of the Board of County Commissioners. Commissioners Ed Humphrey and Claire Corcoran concurred.

The emergency declaration, along with a previous resolution delegating disaster functions in event of an absence of a quorum of the Board, spells out succession of leadership and the authority of the County Administrator in an emergency. It exempts from the competitive bidding process purchases related to the emergency that are greater than $50,000 but less than $100,000, so long as no fewer than three informal estimates are obtained.

The County Administrator is authorized to “take those actions that are necessary and appropriate, including the delegation of administrative and departmental functions among “responsible staff” to assure proper implementation in exercising this authority,” the resolution states. The County Administrator also will “report to the Board of Commissioners on any actions taken pursuant to this resolution.”

In addition to the emergency declaration, the Commissioners suspended Monday meetings (except March 23) into the future as well as suspended public participation.

In the absence of a quorum of the County Commissioners, authority is designated to the County Administrator. In the absence of the County Administrator, the President of the Board may delegate to the Assistant County Administrator or Budget Director.

The resolution also activates the Clermont County Emergency Operations Center for the duration of the emergency in order to coordinate response efforts.

Pam Haverkos, the county’s Emergency Management Agency director, said the declaration would allow the county to obtain state funds in the future if needed.

In addition to the emergency declaration, the Commissioners suspended Monday meetings (except March 23) into the future as well as suspended public participation.

“Through the leadership of Clermont County Public Health and the Clermont County Emergency Management Agency, we’re collaborating with first responders, hospitals, the business community and others to navigate these challenging times,” Painter said. “Our goal is to protect the health of our employees and those they serve. We seek to slow the spread of this highly contagious disease, while continuing to carry forth the essential operations of government.”

Full statement by Commissioner Painter: Extraordinary times require extraordinary actions. I commend each and every one of you for the steps you have taken during this challenging time. It’s inspiring to see people coming together and following the advice of health experts so we don’t overwhelm our health system. People are practicing “social distancing,” as recommended by the experts, so they don’t get infected by this highly contagious disease and pass it on to the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. You’re checking on each other and supporting each other. You’re doing what it takes. You’ve taken steps to protect the public and our employees. I see resilient and innovative people rallying and doing their best at a challenging time. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Clermont County government has made a number of changes in delivery of services. Some of the actions include closing waiting rooms, delaying court hearings, providing services online and getting payments via drop boxes and mail. We are in constant contact with our department heads and elected officials and will provide updates as they become available. We’re continually updating the list, available at www.clermontcountyohio.gov. The list includes specifics about what waiting rooms are closed and alternative ways of doing business with Clermont County government. You’ll see a number of online opportunities for applying for services and new ways to mail or drop off documents. These moves were taken in response to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization, the Ohio Department of Health and our own Clermont County Public Health. Through the leadership of Clermont County Public Health and the Clermont County Emergency Management Agency, we’re collaborating with first responders, hospitals, the business community and others to navigate these challenging times. Our goal is to protect the health of our employees and those they serve. We seek to slow the spread of this highly contagious disease, while continuing to carry forth the essential operations of government. If history concludes that we have defaulted to a position of increased safety that wasn’t warranted, we can live with that. One thing we can’t live with is knowing that we didn’t act when we had the chance and that lack of action resulted in you or your family being hurt. This is a difficult for everyone. Please be patient and understand that everyone here at Clermont County has your safety at heart even when some decisions might make life difficult for a short duration. If you can, limit your social distance from others, protect your children, wash your hands, keep your hands below your face when possible, and help others that need your help. Together we have weathered storms, droughts, floods, tornadoes, power losses, and we will rise to this challenge and overcome. We are Clermont County. May God bless you and your families.",200218,2020-03-20

As of 3:30 p.m. Friday, there were 13 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ohio, with 159 persons “under investigation” (tested but awaiting results), according to the Ohio Department of Health website.

President Donald Trump announced Friday afternoon that he is declaring the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, as Washington struggles with providing Americans with relief and officials race to slow the spread of the outbreak.

Speaking from the Rose Garden, Trump said, “I am officially declaring a national emergency.” He said the emergency would open up $50 billion for state and local governments to respond to the outbreak, according to the Associated Press.

Trump said he was also giving Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar emergency authorities to waive federal regulations and laws to give doctors and hospitals “flexibility” in treating patients.

Trump spoke as negotiations continue between the White House and Congress on an aid package, but there was no announcement of a breakthrough, as House Democrats prepare to vote on their own measure Friday.

“This is a work in progress. We are working as fast as we can to put the support systems into place that need to be there,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Friday. “You can’t write laws to cover every situation. People need to take some responsibility, and we’re seeing it happen. People are getting it.”

DeWine also said Friday afternoon, “Daycares: We are not closing them at this pint, but it could happen in the future. Parents using daycares should start thinking about what their alternatives could be.”

The declaration was issued through an executive order hours after Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said he would issue a similar proclamation of civil emergency.

The county order gives Budish enhanced powers to respond to the coronavirus. Four cases have been confirmed in Ohio, three in Cuyahoga County and a fourth in Stark County.

Read the executive order in the viewer below.

In the case of an emergency that threatens life, health or property, the County Code allows the executive to make supply purchases up to $500,000 and enter into contracts or leases without going through the normal approval processes or requiring competitive bidding.

The executive order also restricts all non-essential travel for county employees, and all other out-of-state or international travel would be subject to approval by the executive on a case-by-case basis.

In addition to the executive order, county custodians are working over time to sanitize public spaces in all county-owned buildings, and the county will pay for additional cleaning services to sanitize public spaces in leased facilities, a spokeswoman said.

The County Code requires Budish to “immediately send a report to County Council and post the report on the county’s website, describing the nature of the emergency, the actions taken, and the estimated cost and sources of funding for the actions taken.”",1263154,2020-03-13

CORONAVIRUS: Officials say 4 of 17 testing positive for coronavirus in Butler County remain hospitalized

Clemmons wrote that the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, may have an impact on the city's ability to operate effectively. The state of emergency will allow Fairfield to suspend some of the city's provisions and processes, which also could include City Council approvals. Provisions and processes could include, but not limited to purchasing policies, competitive bidding, processing of benefits and payment of vendors.

Fairfield City Council held its regularly scheduled meeting on Monday, March 23, 2020, at the municipal building. Council members and key staff attended the meeting, and practiced social distancing guidelines outlined mandated by the state. Though the public was able to attend, no community members attended. Pictured is Councilwoman Leslie Besl.

""We need to ensure that the city is able to provide continuity of services throughout this crisis,"" said City Manager Mark Wendling of the recommendation of the state of emergency declaration.

Additionally, Wendling told Council, “In light of the current crisis, I recommend that raises be deferred until we have a better idea of the overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis.”

The recommendation came as Council considered a salary ordinance to establish pay ranges for ""certain exempt and salaried employees,"" though the legislation did not directly provide raises to employees.

Other COVID-19 impacts in Fairfield

Though the COVID-19 has canceled the Community Arts Center programming, most of the city's parks are open, though not all amenities will be accessible to the public, said Councilwoman Leslie Besl, chair of council's Parks, Recreation and Environmental Committee.

""Our parks are still accessible, with the exception of the dog park, but the playgrounds are closed,"" she said.

Besl said the parks department is also ""looking at ways to connect with our residents"" with virtual events.

Virtual events could include a Facebook Live event, or a printable scavenger hunt for families to participate in as they are in their neighborhoods.

"336","Ohio","Gallia","https://www.mydailytribune.com/top-stories/51203/gallia-declares-state-of-emergency","Gallia declares state of emergency","GALLIPOLIS — Gallia Commissioners voted unanimously Sunday during an emergency meeting in the Gallia 911 Communications Center to declare a state of emergency for Gallia County due to the Ohio COVID-19 outbreak.

The commissioners have declared states of emergency before, especially during extreme incidents of flooding. The declaration allows the county to potentially access state and federal funding in response to crisis situations.

Department heads present were Gallia Sheriff Matt Champlin, Gallia Health Commissioner Dr. Gerald Vallee, Gallia 911 and Emergency Management Agency Director Sherry Daines, Gallia Emergency Management Agency Associate Director and Gallia Firefighter’s Association Representative Tim Miller and Gallia EMS Director Keith Wilson.

“At this time, we do not have any positive (COVID-19 cases) in Gallia County,” said Gallia Public Health Official Tyler Schweickart. “They’re (the state) is basically looking at all public gatherings at this point (for restriction), restaurants and bars… At this point we have the vast majority of events taken care of as far as cancellation of those. Churches are still ongoing at this point… We have reached out to other gathering points… The processes that we have right now in public health are still in the containment (phase)… It’s inevitable we’ll be moving to the mitigation side. Our goal at the health department is to make sure we don’t overwhelm our hospital partners. As of right now, the health department’s primary function with this is assisting the hospital to make sure we can take as much off their plate as possible when we’re still in the containment phase.”

Schweickart said that the health department is advising church-goers to avoid handshakes or acts of fellowship that might put them in close contact with individuals potentially carrying COVID-19.

The health department has been screening individuals as much as possible and sending individuals who meet the Center for Disease Control parameters to medical care.

Vallee urged those who think they may have contracted COVID-19 to contact their primary care physicians or call ahead to medical facilities before showing up so as to not surprise and overload healthcare institutions.

“We need to keep communication going and I think down the road as we’ve established our (emergency operations center), we’ll meet daily to discuss as a group,” said Commissioner Harold Montgomery.

“We declare Gallia County in a state of emergency in regard to this COVID-19 virus,” said Montgomery. “The general purpose is for us to stay in front of this and to be working together with our state agencies. As the state and the federal agencies have already declared (a state of emergency), this will allow Gallia to try and draw some resources.”

“As I’ve watched this evolve over the last really four weeks,” said Commissioner David Smith, “my position is or my opinion is, and I hope I’m wrong, it’s only a matter of time before it comes to Gallia County. I wish I could tell you how (the situation) is going to evolve. This is truly a first time event…We live in a world that travels everywhere and we are starting to see what happens there… It’s going to be a challenge to contain this as best we can.”

Montgomery County commissioners also decided to revise and update the county’s leave policies to give workers additional time off with the goal of helping slow the spread of COVID-19.

But in Warren County, its commission voted 2-1 against an emergency declaration.

Montgomery County needs to take precautions to protect its employees and the citizens it serves during this crisis to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, said Commission President Judy Dodge.

“Taking this step is necessary and will allow us to obtain resources and support we need to address this pandemic from both the state and federal government,” Dodge said.

Greene County officials meet to plan for isolation or quarantine orders

Montgomery and Greene counties passed emergency declarations on Tuesday, following in the footsteps of the state of Ohio and other jurisdictions including the city of Dayton.

Montgomery County’s resolution formalizes the county’s emergency status and the decision to exercise emergency authority provides more flexibility related to staffing and procurement procedures, Dodge said.

Montgomery County began transitioning to emergency operations on Monday to focus resources on “mission critical” services, and the county’s leadership team has reduced staffing levels in non-essential areas, Dodge said.

Officials say the county is taking significant steps to try to deliver essential government services while also following recommended social distancing practices.

“As a result, some normal day-to-day functions and services will not be available because these are not normal times,” Dodge said.

Montgomery County has implemented a flexible leave policy for all of its thousands of employees that included adding two weeks, or 80 hours, of special vacation time so non-essential workers can stay home during this risky period, said Montgomery County Commissioner Debbie Lieberman.

The county will be limiting and freezing non-essential programs and services, stopping all non-essential spending and enacting a hiring freeze in an effort to protect the public and public employees, Liberman said.

Essential personnel will report to work or will work remotely when possible, Lieberman said, and essential services like food stamp and unemployment benefits will still be available, though citizens are encouraged to apply for benefits online to limit physical contact at the Jobs Center.

The county encourages citizens when possible to call and send emails to access needed services and utilize online platforms and payment drop boxes.

The Greene County Commission also passed a resolution Tuesday morning declaring an emergency in the county.

“It allows us to secure state and federal reimbursement funds if/ when they become available,” read a statement from the Greene County commissioners. “It suspends the requirement for competitive bidding and allows us to ensure faster procurement of needed supplies and services. … We continue to hope for the best outcome while planning for the worst case scenarios.”

Melissa Howell, Greene County health commissioner, said the county has responded to small and large health concerns including the opiate crisis, west Nile virus, Ebola and other devastating events like tornadoes. Howell said the county knows how to work well together.

“No one is immune,” Howell said. “For individuals with no symptoms, there would be no test needed. For individuals with mild cold-like symptoms no test would be needed. Individuals with severe illness cough, shortness of breath and fever may be tested.”

Howell said county preparations began when the first reports of the virus came from China.

Warren County commissioners Dave Young and Tom Grossmann voted no, while insisting they were ready to provide more funding to fire and emergency management workers needing equipment when dealing with potential cases.

Grossmann and Young suggested declaring the emergency would cause residents to panic. They noted federal and state states of emergency had already been declared.

Bruce McGary, the county prosecutor advising them, indicated he had found no legal basis for the need for the county declaration.

Commissioner Shannon Jones said the vote on a resolution sought by local emergency management and health officials was advisable and unlikely to create additional panic in the county.

During a 90-minute work session, the commissioners heard appeals from a handful of emergency management officials to declare the emergency to support a change in standard of care to eliminate the transport of residents to be tested for COVID-19 with no other medical problem.

RELATED: Montgomery County to declare emergency: What it means

The officials also said the emergency declaration would also put the county emergency response agencies in line to get more masks and other equipment needed to respond to calls.

“No one is saying this isn’t serious,” Young said. “When we declare a state of emergency, that means something.”

Young and Grossmann emphasized they want to support needed changes, once the legal support has been provided.

During the meeting, Franklin Fire Chief Jonathan Westendorf said Atrium Medical Center in Warren County dealt with a a COVID-19 case last week.

“Atrium Medical Center and other Premier Health hospitals currently have no admitted patients with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Late last week, a person came to Atrium Medical Center to be tested for COVID-19. This person returned home and went into self-quarantine. We have learned that this person did test positive for the virus. The patient is recovering at home. Staff took appropriate precautions as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention when testing this person, and therefore CDC guidelines do not recommend that the staff be isolated or quarantined,” according to a statement issued by Jennifer Burcham, site manager, PR and Community Relations, at Atrium.

Hamilton County commissioners declare a state of emergency today to combat coronavirus","CLOSE Kathrine Nero spoke with Dr. Lynne Saddler of the Northern Kentucky Health Department about what people need to know about the new coronavirus. Cincinnati Enquirer

Hamilton County commissioners declared a state of emergency today as they prepare for the coronavirus pandemic to spread.

""We want to make sure people understand that this is serious,"" said Board of Commissioners President Denise Driehaus. ""This is a health threat in the community. I believe this is a prudent response at the right time.""

This follows the actions of Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley, who on Wednesday declared a state of emergency for the city, and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who declared a state of emergency for Ohio on Monday.

The county's state of emergency doesn't give commissioners power to cancel events, said spokeswoman Bridget Doherty.

But it does allow the county to get reimbursement from the federal government on any expenses related to the pandemic. It also allows the county to make purchases without having to go through competitive bidding.

For instance, if the company that provides food to the jail can no longer due so due to coronavirus, the county can find another food vendor without having to bid it out, she said.

The declaration also gives commissioners the power to establish the joint information center, which would serve as a base of operations for emergency responders, if that becomes necessary.

As of now, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Hamilton County. But people could be walking around spreading it and not know they have it, said Greg Kesterman, interim health commissioner for the Hamilton County Public Health.

The health department is monitoring potential cases in Hamilton County but won't say how many.

About 80% of COVID-19 cases involve mild symptoms that mimic a cold. But for the elderly and people with immune deficiencies, the disease can kill.

Kesterman asked anyone who is feeling ill to stay home, no matter how minor the symptoms.

""Even if you think you have the cold, now is the time to take that precaution,"" Kesterman said. ""We don't want you to make other people sick.""

Kesterman said the state and county have enough COVID-19 tests to meet demand. There have been 82 tests for COVID-19 statewide with enough tests available now for 600-800 people.

He recommended anyone who suspects they have COVID-19 to contact their primary care physician or, if they don't have a primary care physician, an urgent care facility. He said to contact them first by phone so the medical staff can prepare and safely test without risking getting anyone ill.

The physician will then order a test if needed, he said. The samples are sent to a state lab for testing.

County officials urged the public not to panic. Hamilton County Emergency Management Director Nick Crossley said they're asking people to have two weeks worth of food, medicine and water and not gather in large groups.

""It's all pre-emptive,"" Crossley said. ""We can show you the research that if we don't these large gatherings, we can contain this. We anticipate this being a short time.""

Schools are closed. Restaurants and bars are take-out only.

Following the lead of Governor Mike DeWine, the Monroe County Commissioners declared a Public Health Emergency in the county Monday, March 16 during their regular meeting.

The declaration came upon the recommendation of the Monroe County Health Department, citing the more than 1,600 cases of COVID-19 in the country, including a daily-growing number in Ohio.

As part of the measure, the commissioners agreed to close the Monroe County Courthouse to the public starting Tuesday, March 16.

The emergency measures will remain in effect until the emergency no longer exists.

Each county department is responsible for maintaining its day-to-day operations during the courthouse closure and emergency.

A locked door and a list of phone numbers for each county office will meet visitors to the Monroe County Courthouse.

The challenge for each department head is to continue offering necessary services while being closed to the public.

Monroe County Sheriff Charles Black has stopped offering web checks and CCW for the time being. There will be no face-to-face visitation for inmates.

Much like the courthouse, the Sheriff’s Office will be locked.

“You’ll only be allowed into our office if it is a necessity” Black said. “My main concern is the 100 inmates we have out there (and our officers).”

Black will not take any new out-of-county prisoners for the next few weeks until the crisis subsides.

County courts will limit cases over the next few weeks.

County Court Judge Jason Yoss will use Skype for as many hearings as he can while limiting in-person interaction to the “most essential cases.”

Yoss offered the use of his courtroom to Common Pleas Court Judge Julie Selmon and Probate and Juvenile Court Judge James W. Peters to help keep people from walking through the courthouse.

Monroe County Clerk of Courts Beth Ann Rose recommended visitors phone ahead, and her staff would attempt to walk residents through handling their needs online if possible.

If a visitor needed assistance, Rose said her staff could potentially meet visitors in the alley near the entrance to the courthouse.

Monroe County Treasurer Taylor Abbott will place the deposit box up at the courthouse and permit other county offices to use the box for payments and legal documents.

Abbott hopes residents will choose to make their payments online. He offered to waive credit card charges during the courthouse closure.

Other county offices not located at the courthouse are also closing to the public. Those offices include the Monroe County Engineer’s Office, Monroe County EMA and Monroe County Job and Family Services (JFS).

The front door at the Monroe County Senior Center will be locked, which is also where the Monroe County Health Department is located.

In each case, the offices will continue to be staffed. Visitors are encouraged to call each agency.

Monroe County JFS recommends any individual needing to do business with the agency for SNAP, OWF, Medicaid or PRC call 1-844-640-OHIO, Option 2 from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Individuals will need to visit benefits.ohio.gov to apply or check on the status of their public assistance. PRC applications are available at the JFS page on monroecountyohio.com.

For job search activities and unemployment, individuals may visit ohiomeansjobs.com for job links. A claim can be filed at www.unemployment.ohio.gov or by calling 1-877-644-6562.

Child and adult protective services staff will remain accessible during the closure to the public. Staff may be reached at 740-472-1602, Option 5 during regular business hours, 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. or 740-213-5794 after hours.

One county department that will remain active for the time being is Monroe County Public Transportation (MCPT).

Denise Potts, MCPT director, stressed her concern for her staff during the health emergency, but due to MCPT’s contract, it is required to continue operation.

Monroe County Prosecuting Attorney James L. Peters said any decision to limit service would have to come from the state level, which has not been given at this time.",14585,2020-03-21

He made it clear, that NO ONE in Paulding County has the coronavirus and that the couple that were self-quarantined after coming back from Italy, have shown NO SIGNS of the virus.

The need for the State of Emergency is due to the community spread of COVID_19 in Ohio. The Paulding County EMA Director, Edward Bohn, agreed with the decision of the Commissioners declaring a State of Emergency now. Mr. Bohn stated the declaration will streamline purchasing policies and open funding for State and Federal Emergency Funds.

Tony Zartman, Chairman of the Paulding County Commissioners, stated that we want to make sure our citizens in the county understand that this is serious, this is a health threat in our county. We are taking prudent steps to lesson the negative impact to our communities.

Ryan Shackelford, director of the Portage County Emergency Management Agency, said the proclamation demonstrates that the county is enacting its emergency plan and procedures, as well as its operations center, and is doing as much as possible to alleviate the emergency.



""It also acknowledges that the incident is potentially bigger than what we can handle individually and that the need for regional and state assistance may be forthcoming,"" he said. ""It essentially eases restrictions from seeking assistance from state and federal partners, which is similarly the reason for the state and federal declaration.""



The declaration says that the virus is ""rapidly spreading"" and ""the resulting impact of the disease on Portage County residents and businesses is potentially catastrophic."" It calls on citizens to comply with ""necessary emergency measures.""



As of Friday’s update from Gov. Mike DeWine, Portage County was not among the 28 counties impacted by the illness. A total of 169 individuals had a confirmed case of COVID-19, with 39 of those people hospitalized. The disease has claimed the life of a patient from Lucas County.



DeWine proclaimed a state of emergency on March 9.



The proclamation was approved as commissioners live-streamed Thursday’s meeting for the first time, asking the public to stay away. Those who attended were given information on how to find the internet broadcast, and the start of the meeting was delayed by an hour so residents could go home and access the meeting online. The live-steam link for commissioners’ meetings is available on the commissioner’s page at the county website, www.co.portage.oh.us.



Portage County Commissioner Sabrina Christian-Bennett voted against temporarily changing the format of the meetings during the outbreak. She said Brian Ames, who records commissioners meetings and streams them on YouTube, was upset about being excluded from the meeting, and that not enough notice of Thursday’s change was given.



""I was not part of this decision,"" she said.



Assistant Prosecutor Chris Meduri told commissioners that although meetings must be open to the public, Ohio’s law on public meetings does not require the public to be able to speak at those meetings.



Commissioners later discussed the possibility of eventually closing the administration building to the public, and urged department heads to work from home and have their employees do the same. Some said they still had to work from county buildings, but were limiting the number of people who came to the office. For now, the building remains open to the public, but people are being asked to do as much business as possible by phone or email.



Commissioner Kathleen Clyde mentioned the possibility of conducting meetings via video conferencing, which would allow elected officials to stay home, while still providing a broadcast of the meeting to the public.



""I think in light of this crisis, we need to do what we can to protect the public and ourselves,"" she said.

WARREN, Ohio (WKBN) – Trumbull County Commissioners declared a “State of Emergency” in the county due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The declaration was made Saturday morning during a special Board of Commissioners meeting. As part of that declaration, departments under the board’s jurisdiction are staggering work shifts and maximizing remote work access in order to “promote the health and safety of employees and the public.”

Employees under their control are to work remotely if possible.

Those unable to work remotely will operate under staggered shifts.

Departments that are affected by these changes include the Trumbull County Department of Job and Family Services and the Child Support Agency.

All employees in “essential services” will remain on regular schedules.

Commissioner Frank Fuda says the public needs to do its part to stop the spread of the virus.

“I’m also asking the public to do their part. Our public has to realize, this is a combined effort. They have to try to stay in as much as possible,” Fuda said.

Among other things, the declaration reads, “All citizens are called upon and directed to comply with the necessary emergency measures, to cooperate with public officials in executing emergency operational plans and comply with the lawful direction of properly identified officials.”

The declaration take affect immediately and will last for 30 days, unless renewed by a majority of the board of commissioners.

The declaration came at the request of Tuscarawas County Health Commissioner Katie Seward and Alex McCarthy, director of the Tuscarawas County Homeland Security & Emergency Management Agency. It also has support from the cities of Dover, New Philadelphia and Uhrichsville and the Tuscarawas County Sheriff’s Office.

Commissioners said the declaration will make it easier for the county to receive state and federal funding.

Commissioner Chris Abbuhl said it shows that the board is taking a unified approach with the Tuscarawas County Health Department and the county EMA to deal with the crisis.

The three commissioners took turns praising the efforts of Seward, McCarthy, the sheriff’s office, county school superintendents, area hospitals and the Salvation Army during this situation.

“We are in perilous times here and we don't know what's going to happen next, but we do know that our best decisions are educated ones,” Commissioner Al Landis said. “Working as a team, I think we're going to make the right decisions.”

Health officer: 'This disease is going to get worse before it gets better.'

(Update: More from commissioners' meeting, county health director)

BEND, Ore. (KTVZ) -- Deschutes County commissioners officially declared a state of emergency in the county at a special meeting Friday to discuss various aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Commissioners said the emergency declaration is for 60 days, in an effort to provide emergency funds and policies that can better guide the public.

They said they want to make clear that this action is not at adding to any sense of panic, but will open the doors for more funds and support to get ahead of the virus, which has one presumptive case in the county at present.

Dr. George Conway, the county's health services director, recommended the declaration due to the need for supplies and in anticipation of more cases. He said the second, CDC confirmation for the county COVID-19 case should come back within a week and it will no longer be ""presumptive.""

Conway also said the county is monitoring others now, but they are not ""cases,"" only ""persons under monitoring"" due to possible high-risk contact. He said they're not believed to have the virus.

The doctor said there's still no evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted in the air, only by droplets from cougs or sneezes, or someone who touches one on a surface.

""Any time there is a defnable pattern that could help the public, we will share that information,"" Conway told commissioners.

He said an infectious disease nurse has been working with seniors' long-term care facilities in the county since January, putting plans in place and doing proactive training to keep them safe.

Conway said that if the U.S. fails at taking these proactive measures, it will lead to much larger economic catastrophes. Everything people can do to delay the spread also reduces the chances of overwhelming the available resources.

But he also said: ""The disease is going to get worse before it gets better.""

Here's their news release:

Deschutes County Commissioners issue emergency declaration

The Deschutes County Commissioners have issued an emergency declaration in response to COVID-19. The County joins two other Oregon counties that have issued similar declarations.

The emergency declaration authorizes the county to implement emergency actions, access more resources and take appropriate steps to recover some of the costs associated with the County’s response to the disease.

“This emergency declaration will help us to best serve our residents,” said Deschutes County Commission Chair Patti Adair. “We want to be as prepared as possible to help keep our community safe.”

The declaration of emergency comes two days after the Oregon Health Authority announced the first presumptive positive case in a Deschutes County resident.

The Commissioners met Friday to discuss ongoing and emerging COVID-19 related impacts.

During the meeting, Deschutes County Sheriff's Office Emergency Manager Sgt. Nathan Garibay, Health Services Director Dr. George Conway and County legal counsel advised the commissioners that the emergency declaration will help county staff quickly respond and utilize all available resources to best protect the health of our community.

Local public health officials continue to urge residents to wash hands frequently, cover coughs or sneezes and stay home if you show signs of flu or a bad cold, including fever and cough.

DECLARING A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE CITY OF BEND AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC

Bend City Manager Eric King has declared a local state of emergency as a result of the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has been confirmed in Deschutes County. Governor Kate Brown has declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Oregon.

The Bend City Council is scheduled to vote to ratify the declaration, which is in effect through at least April 15, at its meeting Wednesday.

The declaration allows more flexibility and authorization for the City Manager to take actions to help protect the health and safety of the community, through a number of means from limiting access to public places, to buying items or services related to health and safety without normal procurement procedures that can take additional time.

“We need to move fast and be nimble in our responses right now, as this is a rapidly evolving situation,” said Mayor Sally Russell. “This declaration should not inspire concern, but rather, should assure the public that the City is taking every precaution possible to prevent the spread of this virus in our community.”

“My primary focus is to restrict the spread of COVID-19 and to maintain the health of our workforce so employees can continue to provide crucial City services,” said City Manager Eric King. “I have and will continue to develop emergency policies regarding the use of sick leave, vacation leave, telecommuting, meeting protocols, and more, which will be in effect for the duration of the emergency.”

While this emergency is in place, the City will not send shut-off notices or shut off water for non-payment of unpaid water bills and will not allow any permitted special events of more than 250 people.

To eliminate exposure and spread of COVID-19, and in support of state and federal guidelines for social distancing, the City has cancelled all advisory committee meetings and public, project-specific outreach meetings or open houses. City employees are encouraged to telecommute and to conduct meetings through online conferencing tools when possible. Disinfecting and cleaning operations have increased significantly in City facilities.

Currently, scheduled City Council meetings are expected to continue, but with social distancing modifications including increased space between chairs. This results is a smaller capacity in Council Chambers. The City strongly encourages livestreaming the meeting from home through www.bendoregon.gov/councilagenda. Anyone who wishes to communicate with the Council is also welcome to email council@bendoregon.gov.

Bend Police service response to COVID-19:

The City of Bend Police Department recognizes the need to follow State and Federal recommendations related to best practices associated with the spread of, and exposures to, COVID-19. Based on these recommendations we have evaluated and adjusted our services and response to calls for service. These decisions were made to follow social distancing guidelines.

Effective immediately, the City of Bend Police Department will be evaluating calls for service to determine if they can be handled by phone, rather than in person. We also encourage the public to utilize our online reporting portal for appropriate non-emergency crimes. For general police questions we request the public consider calling into our office at (541)322-2960, rather than visiting our police department. The police department will be suspending public finger printing services until further notice.

Future adjustments may be necessary in order to maintain the staff necessary to serve the citizens of our City. Our officers will continue to respond to emergency calls 24 hours a day and 7 days per week.

REDMOND, OREGON – On Tuesday, March 17, Redmond City Council will consider a local state of emergency declaration which allows the City to efficiently respond to the evolving public service needs created by the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus).

Examples include: The need to seek additional resources should an outbreak occur in the Police Department which effects staffing; or to seek reimbursement for costs associated with managing the organization; and other unforeseen time sensitive matters that may arise during a rapidly changing situation.

“This authority gives us the ability to respond to unforeseen needs in a calm and thoughtful, yet timely manner,” states Keith Witcosky, Redmond City Manager.

Based on the state’s guidance to reduce the spread of person-to-person transmission of COVID-19, the City has cancelled all public meetings until April 13, 2020. City Council will meet on March 17 and postpone future meetings until April 14, 2020. This timeframe is subject to change as the situation evolves.

Redmond Utility Billing Department encourages residents to practice social distancing and pay their water bill by mail, by phone at 866-506-8162, or online using the following portal: https://cityofredmond.secure.munibilling.com/customers/sign_in.

News release from Crook County Emergency Management:

As novel coronavirus – aka COVID-19 – continues to spread, local health officials have stressed that the risk to Central Oregonians remains low. Influenza continues to be a much more active threat to our community this time of year. Crook County does not currently have any positive cases of COVID-19.

Crook County Emergency Management, with the support of Crook County Court and the City of Prineville, today approved a County Emergency Health Declaration. The local Health Department supports this declaration and recognizes that this will continue to support the county response to this incident. This declaration will support the need for resources whether that is personnel or supplies. It is consistent with the State Health Emergency Declaration and the National Health Emergency the President announced earlier today.

Crook County and the City of Prineville wants you to know that in partnership with our local and neighboring Health Departments, Law Enforcement, school districts, the Central Oregon Emergency Information Network (COEIN), and medical community, which includes St. Charles Health System, the situation is being monitored very closely and following preparedness plans that are in place for any outbreak response. Constant monitoring and tracking for the spread of the virus not only in Oregon but statewide and globally is ongoing.

Crook County Judge, Seth Crawford stated “It is our goal to continue our preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them”.

The leadership of the county and city respect the privacy of the community members and when there is a positive case announced there will be no release of any identifiable information to protect the patient and family members. With that being said the safety of staff and community members are the highest priority and efforts will continue around releasing updates to the public with the most current information and guidelines available.

The joint city and county preparedness plans outline the process of mitigation, response and recovery for any emergency or disaster.

Local Public Health and the Oregon Health Authority continue to recommend people in Oregon take everyday precautions to prevent the spread of many respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza - The CDC is recommending non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19, and other respiratory infections (including flu and pertussis) by taking everyday preventive actions, including:

If you feel sick, call ahead to your healthcare provider to discuss whether or not you need to be seen.

Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.

Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations, including flu vaccine, eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.

Consult CDC’s travel website for any travel advisories and steps to protect yourself if you plan to travel outside of the US.

Stay home if you are sick and talk with your employer now about a plan if you do become ill and cannot show up for work.

It is advised that anyone with compromised immune systems, chronic medical conditions and the elderly not attend large events and practice social distancing to protect yourselves.

This week the state of Oregon announced a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people. The city and county strongly believe in personal freedoms, including the right to assemble, but the statewide ban on large gatherings makes good sense, and needs to be followed.

There is much that is still unknown about the coronavirus, but what is known is that it is in our communities and we will see positive cases at some point. It is recommended that individuals follow the guidelines being offered to help minimize the spread of the virus. The same precautions are suggested for any communicable disease.

Crook County Circuit Court & Jefferson County Circuit Court

The health and safety of all patrons and employees of the Crook & Jefferson County Circuit Courts are of utmost importance to the courts. We are maintaining regular communications with our state and local public health and emergency management professionals to monitor the developing situation with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In partnership with our state and local preparedness partners, we have developed a comprehensive response plan. We are taking all necessary and available measures to maintain a safe and sanitary space for all employees and patrons of our court.

The courts recognize that requiring people to congregate in close proximity for any period of time is now risky. Therefore, effective March 13, 2020, Crook and Jefferson County Circuit Courts have cancelled all jury trials through April 30, 2020, to be rescheduled as conditions allow.

All other court services remain available during normal business hours.

Need DMV service? Visit DMV2U.oregon.gov

March 13, 2020

SALEM – To help slow the spread of Coronavirus in Oregon, the Oregon DMV asks that customers consider using the many services available online rather than visiting a DMV office in person.

You can do these things 24/7 at DMV2U.Oregon.gov:

Renew registration for most vehicles – even if your tags just expired, you can renew online and print the receipt to take in your car as proof of registration.

– even if your tags just expired, you can renew online and print the receipt to take in your car as proof of registration. Update your address – if you move within Oregon, you must report your new address to DMV within 30 days.

– if you move within Oregon, you must report your new address to DMV within 30 days. Report the sale of your vehicle – if you sell your vehicle, you can take an extra step against future parking tickets and towing/storage fees on that car by reporting the sale to DMV online.

– if you sell your vehicle, you can take an extra step against future parking tickets and towing/storage fees on that car by reporting the sale to DMV online. Get a trip permit if your tags are expired or license plates are lost or stolen, or if you’ve just bought a car without current plates.

“We encourage people to avoid renewing their vehicle registration in field offices when nearly everyone can do it via our DMV2U website,” DMV Administrator Tom McClellan said. “Those most vulnerable to the virus – those age 60 and older or who have underlying health conditions – should especially reconsider an in-person visit to DMV at this time.”

Other less frequently used services are also available at DMV2U.

If possible, DMV also asks that customers reschedule drive tests until a later date.

Any time you need a DMV service, please first check at DMV2U.Oregon.gov to see if you can save yourself a trip to an office. You can also visit OregonDMV.com to see office hours, locations and wait times for most DMVs, and to make sure you have everything you need before your visit.

DMV also accepts many transactions through the mail, and our phone agents (503-945-5000) help people prepare for a DMV visit, if required.

If you visit DMV in person

Most of our larger offices station employees near the front door to answer questions, check paperwork, and orient customers to the lobby/counter/testing areas. We are not turning people away who appear sick, but are preparing signage that helps educate customers about COVID-19 symptoms and preventive steps such as good hygiene.

“We are taking additional precautions with cleaning protocols and sanitation of employee/customer high-contact areas,” McClellan said. “If someone stays home from work due to illness, please don’t consider a trip to DMV as an acceptable activity. Stay home and get well, and don’t risk infecting others in public spaces like a DMV office!” said McClellan.

The meeting was limited to 25 people, including department heads, members of the media and a few members of the public. Grant County EOC Incident Commander Dave Dobler was appointed temporary Grant County Emergency Management Coordinator. The court declared a county emergency in a motion from County Judge Scott Myers:

“I don’t want to be a county that’s left behind by not declaring. If there are advantages for us to declare an emergency as a county alongside state emergency declarations and federal declarations; I would move that we officially, today at 9:33 a.m., declare a county emergency.”

The motion was passed by commissioners. Find the full county court meeting on video on our My Grant/Harney County Facebook page.

FROM GRANT COUNTY JUSTICE COURT:

Declaration will provide more resources to Public Health; still no known COVID-19 cases in county

The Jefferson County Board of Commissioners held an emergency meeting at 4 p.m. Friday, March 13.

The board voted unanimously to declare a state of emergency in Jefferson County due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

No one has tested positive for the virus in Jefferson County, but Deschutes County has three presumptive positive cases. The declaration will help the county access state and federal resources.

The vote followed similar ones in Crook and Deschutes counties.

""As coronavirus -- aka COVID-19 -- continues to spread, local health officials have stressed that the risk to Central Oregonians remains low,"" said a press release from Jefferson County Public Health. ""Influenza continues to be a much more active threat to our community this time of year.""

""The tri-county response has been deliberate and consistent,"" said Public Health Director Mike Baker to the board.

""Public Health proposed this declaration and recognizes that this will continue to support the countywide response to this incident,"" the press release said. ""This declaration will support the need for resources including the costs for personnel or supplies for Public Health to respond to the ongoing situation.""

""The declarations are consistent with the state health emergency declaration and the national health emergency the president announced earlier today,"" it said.

""It is our goal to continue our public health preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them."" Mike Baker, director Jefferson County Public Health

Emily Wegener, the department's emergency preparedness and healthy communities coordinator, said the department is staying in contact with Deschutes and Crook counties, and they are coordinating their response.

""Jefferson County Public Health has developed strong partnerships with our local and neighboring public health departments, law enforcement, school districts, the Central Oregon Emergency Information Network and the medical community, including the St. Charles Health System,"" the press release said. ""The situation is monitored very closely and is following preparedness plans that are in place for any public health incident or outbreak response. Constant monitoring and tracking for the spread of the virus is ongoing, not only locally, but statewide and globally as well.""

Baker said his department has been tracking the time staff is dedicating to the coronavirus for a couple of weeks.

He said he knew they would need additional support, ""and this does allow that to happen.""

In the press release, Baker said, ""It is our goal to continue our public health preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them.""

""Safety of staff and community members are the highest priority and efforts will continue around releasing updates to the public with the most current information and guidelines available,"" the press release continued. ""The leadership of the county respects the privacy of the community members, and when there is a positive case announced there will be no release of any identifiable information to protect the patient and family members.

""Jefferson County preparedness plans outline the process of mitigation, response and recovery for any emergency or disaster. This is a reminder to the community that Jefferson County Public Health has managed many outbreaks over the years and wants you to rest assured full precautions are being followed with this one as well,"" the release said.

Prevention

Jefferson County Public Health and the Oregon Health Authority continue to recommend people in Oregon take everyday precautions to prevent the spread of many respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza.

The CDC is recommending nonpharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19, and other respiratory infections (including flu and pertussis) by taking everyday preventive actions, including:

If you feel sick, call ahead to your healthcare provider to discuss whether or not you need to be seen.

Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.

Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations, including flu vaccine, eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.

Consult CDC's travel website for any travel advisories and steps to protect yourself if you plan to travel outside of the US.

Stay home if you are sick and talk with your employer now about a plan if you do become ill and cannot show up for work.

It is advised that anyone with compromised immune systems, chronic medical conditions and the elderly not attend large events and practice social distancing to protect yourselves.

""This week the state of Oregon announced a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people,"" the press release said. ""Jefferson County strongly believes in personal freedoms, including the right to assemble, but the statewide ban on large gatherings makes good sense, and should to be followed.

""There is much that is still unknown about the coronavirus, but what is known is that it is in our communities and we will see positive cases at some point,"" the press release continued. ""It is recommended that individuals follow the guidelines being offered to help minimize the spread of the virus. These are the same precautions suggested for any communicable disease.

For more information or general questions, contact Jefferson County Public Health at 715 SW Fourth Street, Madras, or 541-475-4456.

The public may also call 211 for general inquiries. The call center is set up to take calls.

County sick leave

The commissioners also approved temporary changes to the county's sick leave policy, provided they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and commit to Oregon Health Authority and Centers for Disease Control guidelines for home isolation.

In those cases, employees can accrue sick leave up to 80 negative hours; they will be charged 75% of their regular sick leave hours for each full shift while under home isolation; and they will not be required to present a doctor's note before returning to work unless they have been absent for more than 15 days.

The Madras Pioneer will continue to publish updates on COVID-19, as well as a list of event cancellations.",21145,2020-03-15

The City of Springfield declared a local state of emergency Monday night. The City of Eugene and Lane County both are expected to do the same Tuesday.

Springfield, which has a regular city council meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. Monday evening, voted to approve the declaration and then voted to approve allowing the use of $100,000 from the general fund for fighting the outbreak.

The Eugene City Council is expected to make an emergency declaration at a special noon meeting at Eugene Public Library on Tuesday. The Lane County Board of Commissioners will decide on making an emergency declaration at its normal meeting at the Public Service Building in Eugene at 9 a.m. Tuesday.

City of Springfield Spokeswoman Amber Fossen said an emergency declaration would:

– Fully implement its Emergency Operations Plan, which governs how the city Emergency Operations Center will operate.

– Suspend contracting requirements for emergency goods and services.

– Temporarily exempt emergency medical facilities or other necessary development from permit requirements.

– Order additional special regulations or requirements if other emergency matters come up for council approval after-the-fact as soon as possible.

According to city counselors at the meeting, the emergency declaration was instituted to make daily operations run smoother and to give City Manager Ron Chandler more tools to take action when needed in a more timely fashion.

From the Lincoln City Municipal Code:

A state of emergency exists whenever any part of the city of Lincoln City is suffering or in imminent danger of suffering from a tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snow or ice storm, drought, fire, explosion, health hazard, infestation, toxic substance, civil disorder, disruption of community services, or any other catastrophe whereby extraordinary measures must be taken to save lives, to protect public health, safety and welfare, to minimize destruction of property or the environment, or to avert or lessen the threat of a major disaster. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1)

CITY MANAGER UPDATE

One city counselor had reservations with voting for the declaration because they did not want to add to the panic and confusion. He proceeded to ask questions to make sure they were doing the right thing.

“In trying times, take a deep breath and try to remain calm,” the counselor said. “We have a great community that cares and helps each other. Businesses are still open. Just remember to wash your hands, love on your kids and family and shop local. We’ll all get through this together.”

Under the declaration, the city manager can redirect funds for emergency use, prohibit price gouging and issue other emergency orders.

Restricting travel and curfews are a couple extreme examples of what the city manager can do, and curtailing commercial activity, prohibiting or restricting the sale of alcohol and cannabis, and prohibiting the possession of loaded firearms on public streets, public property or any outdoor place are all powers granted to the city manager. For a full list check out the Lincoln City Municipal Code:

MUNICIPAL CODE: EMERGENCY OPERATIONS

City offices will remain open although the City prefers to conduct business by phone.

From the City of Lincoln City’s website:

Gatherings of 25 or more individuals are prohibited.

Governor Brown at the same time urged Oregonians to avoid being around 10 people at a time and suggested businesses that cannot serve customers in a way that minimizes interpersonal contact should shut down completely during the pandemic. In response to both the emergency and Governor Brown’s directives, the City of Lincoln City has taken the following actions:

1. The Lincoln City Culinary center will close from March 17, 2020 through April 17, 2020.

Oregon public health officials announced that seven more individuals are presumed infected with the novel coronavirus, including a person in Marion County. Gov. Kate Brown on Sunday declared a state of emergency as the total number of people reported to be infected doubled since Saturday.

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown Sunday declared a state of emergency as officials detected seven new cases of the novel coronavirus, including the first known case in Marion County.

Five new cases were reported in Washington County, where a school employee was diagnosed with the disease at the start of Oregon’s outbreak, and one case in Douglas County.

The announcement of the new cases brings to 14 the known presumed cases of people infected with COVID-19.

“Today’s news is both troubling and expected,” said Pat Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority. “We know we will see more cases.”

Authorities were releasing few details about the new patients, but said the person ill in Marion County contracted the disease through community spread, not from foreign travel or contact another person known to be infected.

“I am declaring a state of emergency,” Brown said in a Sunday news conference with health officials.

DOCUMENT: Governor's declaration of emergency

The governor’s declaration is intended to free up more state resources to combat the spread of the disease. That includes activating a corps of retired medical professionals to help, including in conducting trace investigations to identify anyone who has had contact with those diagnosed as infected.

Allen urged Oregonians to take the outbreak seriously and to not stigmatize those who are infected or under monitoring.

“We cannot combat COVID-19 if we turn on each other,” Allen said.

Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?

There is no reason at this time to think that any animals, including pets, in the United States might be a source of infection with this new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States.

Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.

However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.

Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19?

You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the new coronavirus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.

What about imported animals or animal products?

CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.

What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States?

At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.",11336,NA

Most county offices will close to the public, operating by phone and email instead.

Tillamook County Commissioner Bill Baertlein said the declaration was necessary due to the rapidly developing situation around COVID-19. Commissioners Mary Faith Bell and David Yamamoto agreed with the necessity. No COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in the county at this time.

""Are we going to be infected,"" Yamamoto said. ""I can tell you pretty much yes, we will.""

Votes for a resolution declaring the emergency and enacting a contingency plan passed unanimously. The state of emergency will last until April 1, when it will be re-evaluated.

Access to the Tillamook County Courthouse will be screened. County department offices at the courthouse will serve the public by appointment. The Community Development office will close to the public, but will serve people by phone and email. County Public Works will be closed to the public, though the solid waste transfer stations remain open.

The north courthouse entrance will be closed. Those who need to access the building should use the south entrance. Access to the Justice Court, District Attorney’s office, Juvenile Department and Circuit Court will be available. Handicapped access to the courthouse also remains available.

The Tillamook County Health Department will still be open. Public access will be closed off at the Tillamook County Sheriff’s Office, but jail visitations will continue. All Tillamook County libraries and the Tillamook County Pioneer Museum will close immediately.

The Tillamook County Fairgrounds is suspending all events of 250 people or more in compliance with Gov. Kate Brown’s mass gathering ban. Canceled and rescheduled events include the Spring Bazaar, Creamery Association meeting, roller derby practice, Collectors West Gun/Knife Show and the Headlight Herald Home & Garden Show.

“This is a very fluid situation and things are changing rapidly,” Yamamoto said.

Concerned about the impact of a possible COVID-19 spread in the area, Bell said with only a few intensive care beds, Tillamook County lacks the capacity to handle a serious outbreak.

A Tillamook lumber mill worker was tested for coronavirus Thursday, March 12, leading operations to shut down for cleaning.

Plant Manager Mark Elston issued a statement about the employee and the closure. In the statement, Elston said the employee was tested at the local hospital and advised by medical professionals to self-quarantine at home pending results.

“The employee is following that advice and has committed to inform us of a positive or negative result once known,” Elston said. “We will let our employees know this result and will keep the appropriate community leaders informed.”

Elston said upon learning of the possible infection, Hampton Lumber Mill closed to clean and sanitize the areas the employee frequented. Break rooms, restrooms, offices, and control rooms were sanitized by a local cleaning service.

“We take the health and safety of our employees and the community very seriously. We will monitor the situation and take the appropriate action to safeguard our employees and our operation as we get additional information,” Elston said.

The commissioners voted 3-0 to pass a resolution declaring an emergency as a local response to the outbreak of COVID-19.

J.B. Brock, Union County emergency services manager, said the resolution will help the county to respond faster to situations related to the new coronavirus.

It will give the county the authority to take certain steps, such as like drawing money from a variety of funds for the purchase of protective equipment and the like.

The declaration also provides the county the authority to take steps such as bypassing the bidding process if a contractor needs to be hired for an urgent project.

Commissioner Donna Beverage said the emergency declaration will make it easier for the county to help those in need of assistance.

“It will unleash opportunities for us to help,’’ Beverage said, noting that local business owners are among those who could be assisted by the county.

Brock told the commissioners before their vote that everyone needs to help each other to survive the COVID-19 crisis.

BEAVER COUNTY (KDKA) — The first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Beaver County.

Beaver County commissioners held a press briefing on Monday night to announce one resident tested positive for coronavirus.

Officials also declared a state of emergency in the county.

“Our first steps, first and foremost, is the safety of our residents,” Beaver County Commissioner Daniel Camp said.

The county was notified by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency at 7 p.m., officials say.

Peter Carbone, superintendent of Aliquippa School District, says the patient is a member of the Aliquippa School District community.

“The information has not been officially confirmed by county, Pennsylvania and federal officials,” Carbone said in a release. “Due to confidentiality consideration, I am not able to share any other details.”

No other details about the resident were released.

“We’ve been talking about this for 10 days,” Beaver County Commissioner Jack Manning said. “We’ve been working on plans. We’ve been implementing what we can.”

Officials say Beaver is classified fourth-class county, so they can only recommend businesses and restaurants/bars to close.

They cannot FORCE businesses to close.

The new case now brings the total number of infected people in Pennsylvania to at least 77.

Six of those confirmed cases are in Allegheny County, and one case is in Washington County.

Berks County has declared a disaster emergency due to the threat of coronavirus.

- Advertisement -

Chief Administrative Officer Ron Seaman said at a county commissioners meeting Thursday morning that the declaration should not be seen by the public as a signal to panic, but rather a way to make sure the county can respond as quickly as possible if an outbreak occurs.

“In any kind of situation like this, time is of the essence,” he said. “And acting sooner rather than later is always beneficial. This will allow us to relax the standard in which we normally have to operate so that we can make valid and rational decisions in this ever-changing climate.”

Berks has not yet had a reported case of COVID-19, the coronavirus that has been spreading across the globe.

As of today, there were 22 cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, according to the state Department of Health.

Berks County Solicitor Christine Sadler said the emergency declaration will allow officials to mobilize quickly and activate a menu of powers they can use to respond to a crisis situation. It also allows the commissioners to conduct meetings as necessary without having to publicly advertise those meetings 24 hours in advance.

Seaman said Berks County Department of Emergency Services Director Brian Gottschall has been collaborating with school districts, local health professionals and municipalities to ensure the appropriate people have the supplies and resources needed to continue services.

Last week, the board decided to set aside $10,000 in emergency spending to be used exclusively to fund activity related to the coronavirus response. Seaman said he will provide a weekly report outlining expenses to various departments for review.

""This $10,000 isn't a cap,"" Commissioners Chairman Christian Y. Leinbach said at a budget and operations meeting last Thursday. ""The $10,000 is simply a starting point for the fund, and we wanted to establish this fund so that everything is thought out and documented.""

In addition to declaring an emergency disaster, the county is also asking people to refrain from visiting Berks Heim nursing home to help ensure the safety of residents and staff.

“We understand the importance of loved ones remaining in contact and encourage visitors to use alternative communication methods if possible,” Seaman said. “All individuals, including staff, who come into the building are being screened.”

He added that Berks Heim administrators are in close contact with the local and state emergency management agencies and following guidelines set by those agencies.

There will also be no visitation permitted at the county prison in Bern Township. A message posted on the facility website said there will be no family or friend visitation as well as no professional visitation until further notice.

Leinbach asked residents to avoid gathering in large crowds and practice good hygiene to limit the spread of the coronavirus as much as possible.

Commissioner Kevin S. Barnhardt said the county is working to make the April 28 primary election as safe as possible for those who want to vote on the touchscreen machines at their polling locations. He said poll workers will be required to wear gloves to prevent the spread of the illness.

But he also urged residents to consider casting their votes by mail to avoid lines and crowded spaces. Applications for mail-in ballots can be found on the homepage of the election services website.

“We just want to make sure people are utilizing every tool necessary to be able to vote,” he said. “We really hope that people take advantage of this new option.”

Commissioner Michael Rivera reminded residents that they should be checking a website the county launched last week that is specifically designed to communicate information about the coronavirus.

“We have been working with state and federal authorities and local experts to make sure we are providing the most accurate information to our residents because we feel that it’s important we do all that we can to limit the spread as much as possible,” he said.

The board also voted on Thursday to formally establish a chain of command with respect to the response.

Because the county does not have its own health department like some of its neighboring counties, the commissioners have been designated to take the lead on the response effort by coordinating public-health initiatives and creating a centralized system to distribute health information. Seaman will be second in that chain, Gottschall will serve as third in that line and a public relations coordinator will serve as the final link in the chain.",413521,NA

A Butler Health System doctor believes that the rural county has an advantage because most of the cases have been in densely populated regions. He advises people to listen to the recommendations and stay home. The rate coronavirus is spreading is a substantial challenge.

BHS Dr. David Rottinghaus says they’ve been tracking the pandemic for weeks. They have plans to have an all hands on deck approach at the hospital and preparing for surges in cases before it gets better.

He says the health system just gained access to testing last week. They’ve tested roughly 60 people, but turn around time for the test results is about five days.

Because testing is limited, Dr. Rottinghaus says if you have mild symptoms it’s best to just protect yourself.

The Butler County emergency management director says there are no confirmed cases in the county, but they do know of over 80 tests that have been sent out without results.

The county is taking precautions in response to the disaster emergency declaration. People who want to enter into the Butler County Government Center will be subjected to a healthcare screening requirement before getting inside the building.

There will also be limited access to the judicial systems in the county as well as the prison. The prison has suspended all visitors and are screening employees, as well as any new arrestees.

Officials say they’ve had a pandemic plan since 2007, and they’re now putting it into place.

With a county of 57 municipalities, leaders say there are going to be a lot of questions that will need answered. Starting Thursday, there will be a public phone number set up for anyone in Butler County to call: 724-431-0982.

Ratifies, Extends State of Emergency Declaration","CLEARFIELD – In response to the coronavirus pandemic and Gov. Tom Wolf’s orders, the Clearfield County Commissioners on Tuesday ratified its county-wide state of emergency declaration and extended it through the duration of the crisis.

Commissioner Chairman Tony Scotto said all county facilities are currently closed to the general public, and they will not permit visitors until further notice. He said drop boxes are in place, and county officials can be reached by phone, e-mail or mail.

The primary county phone number is 814-765-2641 (a complete directory is available online), and residents can also find more information on the Clearfield County Government Web site: www.clearfieldco.org.

Commissioner Dave Glass said there’s a lot of confusion surrounding the mandated closures, and the answer is that state officials have left it up to each county to decide what’s essential and how to handle situations.

At the present time, he said the county hasn’t laid anyone off, and the commissioners are hoping to avoid that if they can. But, he added, that the situation is constantly changing and they’ll just have to see how it goes.

“It changes almost daily,” Glass said, “and every time we try to make a plan, something changes. We have a plan and it’s going to change again so we’re thankful for everyone’s patience and ability to work together.”

Commissioner John A. Sobel reminded that Wolf has ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses to close to the public, and that the commissioners urge compliance to the governor’s mitigation efforts.

He said the commissioners understand many of the county’s small business owners are concerned with either having to shut down temporarily or having a significant loss in business.

He said they want business owners to carefully follow the guidelines from various levels of government so that everyone can stay safe. He also encouraged residents who feel comfortable to patronize the businesses that are able to remain open.

“Eventually, the restrictions associated with the pandemic will be lifted,” he said, “and when they are, let’s swamp our local businesses … because they make life so much better in Clearfield County and are going to need our help to get back on their feet.”

Sobel said that all three commissioners are available to help local business owners in any way they can, including with finding and providing information with regards to financial assistance.

Glass stressed that COVID-19 is a rapidly-evolving public health crisis, guidelines are changing almost daily and the commissioners will keep the public up to date with the most current information.

He said there’s already been talk in the state legislature about possibly postponing the April 28 Primary Election until June, which he believes will happen because no one is in position to hold an election at this time.

Glass said the county will notify residents when that becomes official and more information is available.

Because the county has no idea how long this crisis will last, Scotto urged residents to diligently follow the federal and state guidance for social distancing, not congregating in large groups and limiting unnecessary travel.

Tuesday commissioners’ meeting was open to the press, but streamed live on YouTube for the public. The April 7 workshop meeting was cancelled for public safety reasons, and the commissioners will decide protocol for its April 14 voting meeting when that date approaches.

Below is the complete declaration of disaster emergency for Clearfield County.

What are the symptoms of the coronavirus and what should you do?

According to the Centers for Disease Control, reported illnesses from COVID-19 have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death. Fever, cough and shortness of breath might appear 2 to 14 days after you've been exposed to the virus.

If you think you've been exposed to the coronavirus and develop a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your primary healthcare provider immediately.

With further spread of the virus and disruptions to everyday life expected, officials remind residents to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.

You should also cover coughs and sneezes with your elbow (not your hands), clean surfaces that are frequently touched (such as countertops, light switches and phones), and stay home if you are sick.

People are also asked not to attend large gatherings and to practice ""social distancing."" On Monday, President Donald Trump announced new guidelines Americans should follow over the next 15 days, including avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people.

Erie Mayor Joe Schember on Tuesday issued a state of emergency declaration for the city, effective immediately, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The action followed the declaration of a national emergency by President Donald Trump, and Gov. Tom Wolf’s similar action on the state level.

According to the commissioners’ proclamation, the coronavirus has caused or threatens to cause injury, damage and suffering to Juniata County and has “endangered the health, safety and welfare of the substantial number of persons residing in Juniata County.” The commissioners said COVID-19 threatens to create problems greater in scope than Juniata County may be able to resolve.

Emergency management measures are required to reduce the severity of this epidemic and to protect the health, safety and welfare of affected residents in Juniata County, according to the commissioners.

The commission has directed Juniata County Emergency Management Coordinator Allen Weaver to take “all appropriate action needed to alleviate effects of the disaster, to aid in the restoration of essential public services and to take any other emergency response action deemed necessary to respond to this.”

Additionally, due to the state of emergency, Juniata County has implemented the following measures effective immediately. The public entry point for all courthouse business will remain at the Bridge Street entrance for essential transactions only. The wheelchair-accessible entrance remains at the rear of the courthouse. Entrance doors for the Annex and Bousum buildings and other offsite facilities will be locked; however, staff will be available for essential business and to receive phone calls and emails. There will be a drop off and pick up area for essential documents that will be placed near the Bridge Street entrance. A list of affected agencies is included with this story.

So, the commissioners have declared a state of emergency for the county.

NEW CASTLE — With cases of the COVID-19 virus getting closer and closer to the county, the Lawrence County Commissioners decided Tuesday morning it was time to act.

The commissioners unanimously agreed to declare a state of emergency for the county.

The designation will allow officials to call emergency meetings without normal public notice to deal with health and safety issues, puts residents on further alert and opens the possibility the county could eventually be eligible for state and federal disaster funds if needed.

Morgan Boyd, commissioners chairman, said they intend to make every effort to inform the public of upcoming meetings or at least brief them on what happens at each meeting.

A leadership council to oversee the emergency also was created. It will include the commissioners, the county chief administrator, the sheriff, the emergency management coordinator, the human resources director and the county medical director.

Although Lawrence County has not had any positive or even suspected cases of the virus yet, county Public Safety Director Jeff Parish said, ""It’s not if, it’s when it’s going to affect us.""

Tuesday’s move was precipitated by news the night before that a confirmed case had been reported in neighboring Beaver County. Cases also have been reported in Allegheny and Washington counties over the last few days, a sign the disease is moving into southwestern Pennsylvania after weeks of it only being reported in the eastern part of the state.

Gov. Tom Wolf issued a proclamation of emergency for the state two weeks ago and last week ordered all public K-12 schools be closed until the end of the month. On Monday, Wolf urged all non-essential businesses to close for two weeks and for all bars and restaurants to move to take out or delivery only.

Boyd said world health organizations have described the virus’ spread as a pandemic and noted many countries and other states also are struggling with its impact.

Fellow commissioner Loretta Spielvogel added, ""We haven’t thought we were immune to something happening, not just in the state, but also the world.""

Boyd said county officials have been discussing the situation for weeks and have been making adjustments all along. He said the courthouse remains open and county business continues to be conducted, but all residents are being urged to limit their visits. Also, regular cleanings of the building have been increased and hand sanitizer stations have been created near entrances. Travel by county employees also has been restricted.

Many departments have asked residents to pay bills and fines, seek forms and conduct other business with their offices through telephone, mail or online. Drop boxes outside also are available for checks.

Commissioner Dan Vogler said he understands what has been going on is scary, but he urged everyone to remain calm. ""This is a new situation for all of us,"" he said.

Vogler and other officials said they are doing all they can to protect residents and get the county through the crisis. Parish said the goal is to ""flatten the curve"" and make sure everyone doesn’t get sick at the same time and overwhelm local health care facilities.

Noting he and other department heads have been in constant contact with their peers in neighboring counties, Parish said they are doing a lot behind the scenes to get on top of the situation.

""We have a plan for everything,"" he said, noting every part of the county is covered by plans.

Boyd urged everyone to follow health department guidelines about social distancing and proper hand washing to limit the spread and those who do feel symptoms consult with their doctors.

He stressed the need to get proper information on what is going on from government and legitimate news services, not social media sites, which have been spreading false statements that could be dangerous and make things worse.",89333,2020-03-19

“So that we can respond immediately to the needs of our first responder communities and citizens,” Westmoreland County Public Safety Director Bud Mertz said.

At this point, they said people have been tested but none have been presumptive positive as of 1:00 p.m. on Saturday.

They activated their county emergency operations center and put it at an enhanced stage. According to their public safety director, that’s one step before they get outside help.

“We are not implementing any policies other than directives that are coming down from the state and federal government,” Board of Commissioners Chairman Sean Kertes said Saturday morning.

They are asking people to stay away from the courthouse unless you have to be there. County commissioners say jury duty has been suspended.

They are not allowing people to assemble outside in courthouse square outside the county courthouse.

“If you have to come here for court or other mandated things we understand that but if you can find a way to stay home and not come here. We would rather you not enter the building,” Kertes said.

As for testing, Excela Health Chief Medical Officer Doctor Carol Fox said there are limited tests available in their region.

“With that said, we are collaborating very closely with the dept of health and their epidemiologist to ensure individuals who need testing can get testing,” she said.

They are asking people who feel they may need to be tested to reach out to their primary care doctor to get the process started.

At the conference, County leaders addressed the special election that is scheduled for Tuesday. It is still one. They will have the machines wiped down after each person.

The City Council approved the measure unanimously in a special, remote session on Monday.

The state of emergency was declared during a special Newport City Council session on March 15.

In addition, the city government is asking all out-of-state travelers and seasonal residents coming into the city to self-quarantine for 14 days. In particular, part-time residents from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts coming to their Newport homes are asked to stay at home and self-monitor for symptoms to help slow the spread of the virus.

""With a large population of seasonal and part-time residents, we are acutely aware of the potential for community spread associated with interstate travel,"" the city said in a release.

This week, the Rhode Island Department of Health said most new cases are connected with domestic travel rather than international travel, and Governor Gina Raimondo has called for anyone flying into the state to self-quarantine. National Guard members have been stationed inside T.F. Green Airport to greet incoming travelers and collect information to help with contact tracing.

Newport's stay-at-home recommendation remains voluntary at this time, unlike Block Island, which called for an island-wide shelter-in-place on Monday.

Newport residents are reminded that all close-contact businesses, such as nail salons, gyms and movie theaters are closed following an executive order from the governor. The city's public recreation facilities such as basketball courts and playgrounds have also been shut down for the time being.

Beaches remain open at this time, though the city said officials will""be vigilant in monitoring"" for gatherings of 10 people or more.

The declarations came two days after the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control announced that three people in Beaufort County had tested positive for the virus and were in isolation.

DHEC said two of the people “are close contacts of each other and had known exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19 from another state.” The third person “has no known connection to any other case and recently traveled internationally.”

DHEC representatives did not immediately respond to requests for updates on the cases Monday.

The Beaufort County state of emergency, approved unanimously Monday by County Council, allows county administrator Ashley Jacobs the authority to “take any necessary actions for protections of the health, safety and welfare of Beaufort County citizens,” according to the ordinance.

The actions noted in the ordinance are:

• Utilize all available resources of county and municipal government as reasonably necessary to cope with the COVID-19 emergency.

• Transfer the direction, personnel or functions of county departments, agencies, etc., as needed for purposes of facilitating or performing emergency services.

• Contract, requisition and compensate for goods and services from private sources.

• Prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destinations in connection with evacuations or relocations.

• Suspend or limit nonemergency activities and prohibit public assemblies,

Jacobs said Monday that county funds used under the declaration are eligible for state recompensation.

The state of emergency is in place until May 16.

Bluffton introduced its COVID-19 Operations Plan on Monday. A news release said its primary goal is to “minimize exposure between Town of Bluffton staff and the public.”

As of Monday, the town will remain open with reduced staff and functions. All public meetings are canceled, as is Bluffton Municipal Court. All municipal court cases scheduled for March 24 will be rescheduled.

The town is encouraging the public to use electronic payment methods. Business licenses can be renewed and accommodations tax and hospitality tax payments can be made on the town’s website: www.townofbluffton.sc.gov. The public can email forms, questions and applications to BusinessLicense@townofbluffton.com. Questions concerning payments can also be directed to 843-706-4501.

Town parks will remain open but public restrooms may be closed for cleaning and based on town staff resources.

News and updates can be found on the town’s Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages.

The public can be added to the town’s distribution list and receive all of its media releases and meeting notices. Sign up through the town website or email public information officer Debbie Szpanka at dszpanka@townofbluffton.com and ask to be added to the mailing list.

The lead agency in the state during a public health emergency is DHEC, which works closely with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Coronavirus updates, news and guidelines on the disease can be found at scdhec.gov and cdc.gov.

According to DHEC, there were 33 confirmed cases of the virus in the state as of Monday, compared to 29 on Sunday and 13 on Friday. One of the cases resulted in the state’s first coronavirus-caused death, an elderly person in Lexington County.

“We emphasize the importance of practicing disease prevention measures and following recommendations for social distancing to protect our community as a whole,” Dr. Brannon Traxler, a DHEC physician consultant, said in a news release.

The release said people with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath should call their healthcare provider. If an individual doesn’t have a primary care physician, several health care systems are providing telehealth services so residents may be evaluated by a provider without having to leave their homes.

If it’s determined an individual should be tested, they will be instructed where to go to be tested. Individuals with minor illness are advised not to go to emergency departments, the release said.

Beaufort Memorial Hospital posted a news release Sunday asking for patients or loved ones to call ahead in the event that they have a fever, cough and shortness of breath.

“Your doctor's office will ask you a few questions and then give you appropriate instructions, which may include coming to their office for care or reporting to another site to receive rapid influenza and strep tests,” the post said.

“In some cases, patients may be asked to wait in their cars while a medical provider administers and processes the tests. Patients may be given additional instructions to receive Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) testing.”

Patients must have a physician’s order before receiving a COVID-19 test.

Patients who are sick and concerned about COVID-19 can initiate a video visit with a provider using the BMH Care Anywhere app.

Over the weekend, the hospital opened a drive-thru testing site for patients who have a physician order for a COVID-19 test.

The testing site near the Beaufort Memorial Medical and Administrative Center at 990 Ribaut Rd. in Beaufort is directly across from the hospital. It will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 1-5 p.m. Sunday.

On Monday, hospital representatives did not provide comment when asked for an update regarding the status of four staff members who were in self-quarantine after having contact with two people undergoing testing for the coronavirus.

Spokesperson Courtney McDermott said Saturday the hospital would not confirm if the Beaufort County cases were among those it sent to DHEC for testing.

The hospital has the following visitor restrictions in place:

• Only immediate family members over age 18 are allowed to visit patients.

• Only one visitor per patient is allowed. Additional visitors should not come to the hospital.

• Groups of visitors “taking turns” in and out of a patient’s room will not be permitted.

• Visitors with any symptoms of illness will not be allowed to visit patients or patient care areas.

The restrictions will remain in place until further notice.

Hilton Head Regional Healthcare currently has similar restrictions in place:

• No visits from children under the age of 18.

• Visitation is limited to one visitor per patient.

• No visits from people with fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath.

• No visits to any patient who is being tested or has a confirmed case of COVID-19.

For prevention, the public is reminded to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs with an elbow, stay home when sick, don’t attend public gatherings, and appropriately dispose tissues and other items with germs on them.",171838,2020-03-18

Transfer the direction, personnel or functions of county departments and agencies or units thereof for purposes of facilitating or performing emergency services as necessary or desirable; and

Contract, requisition and compensate for goods and services from public and private sources; and

Prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destinations in connection with evacuations or relocations, if any: and

Suspend or limit nonemergency activities and prohibit public assemblies; and

Any and all other actions deemed necessary by the Administrator for the preservation of the health, safety and welfare of citizens, residents, and visitors of Sumter County, South Carolina.

The county also suspended action on all other codes and ordinances until the end of April.

The emergency declaration will remain in force until emergency conditions associated with COVID-19 have subsided and the emergency activities of Sumter County are no longer necessary, or until 61 days passes.

After the meeting, Mixon said he in a statement he appreciates the working relationship he has with County Council.

“We may have some difficult days ahead but I know the citizens of Sumter County are resilient and patient and we will all have to pull together until we are through this emergency,” he said.

What is the Coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more serious diseases such as pneumonia. DHEC is working with CDC to identify all those who might have been in contact with these individuals. These people will be monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms.

People can help to prevent the spread of the virus in the following ways:

wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. And, always wash your hands with soap and water if they are visibly dirty.

avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

stay home when you’re sick.

cough or sneeze into your elbow or use a tissue and put it in the trash immediately.

clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

get the influenza vaccine.

“Our priority is to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of our community,” said County Mayor Bob Rial. “The power granted to county mayors and county legislative bodies by the state Legislature is very limited in circumstances of this nature, but we continue to communicate and work with the governor’s office and various state agencies to control and treat the spread of the virus in our county.”

Rial said the COVID-19 virus has “generated a worldwide challenge that we must face in order to protect ourselves, our families and our world.”

The county mayor said he’s asking citizens to adhere to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to limit exposure to themselves and others, and to blunt the spread of this virus.

“It has been our goal in Dickson County to remain ready and prepared to battle this pandemic and the challenges it has presented,” Rial said. “With all of us working together, we will meet this challenge. I ask for your continued support and prayers for all at this time.”

Salons and spas are asked to limit operations to comply with CDC guidelines. Churches are urged to hold services virtually if possible.

This is a developing story. County Mayor Jim Coppinger will discuss the case at a press conference beginning at 3:10 p.m.

Meanwhile, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state increased to 26 on Friday from Thursday’s total of 18, according to the Tennessee Department of Health’s daily virus update.

Davidson County now has the most confirmed cases — 10 — followed by Williamson County, which has 9 people with confirmed infections. Knox County also got its first confirmed case.

The latest jump in cases comes a day after Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee declared a state of emergency to accelerate the state’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. On Thursday, the total number of presumed or confirmed COVID-19-infected residents doubled over the course of 24 hours.

Earlier Friday, Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke declared a state of emergency and some operational changes to city government to prevent the spread of the then impending virus.

At a press conference, Berke said the city would be suspending all event permits, establishing continuation plans to minimize working city staff, closing certain social centers among other preventive measures to encourage social distancing.

“What we know is one of the most effective ways to deal with COVID-19 is to reduce density through what they call social density,” the mayor said. “We are trying to figure out as a community how to make sure that happens.”

Berke compared preventing the spread of the virus to extinguishing a pan fire, but said fighting it after it’s become widespread is more akin to a kitchen fire. Accordingly, he announced a state of emergency in the city and an executive order creating new policies for prevention in the city including:

— Suspending all public access and activities at all Chattanooga Youth and Family Development Centers and Chattanooga Library branches beginning on Saturday, March 14, until further notice.

— Postponing events at the Tivoli Theatre, Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Auditorium, Walker Theatre and Finley Stadium until further notice.

— Suspending all public access and activities at the Eastgate Senior Center and cancel all city-sponsored senior activities until further notice.

(WATE) — In response to combatting the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), city Mayor Indya Kincannon declared a state of emergency on Monday.

The declaration gives “flexibility as needed to have legal and budgetary actions as needed as we cope with COVID-19.” The mayor also strongly urged people to stay home and practice social distancing.

In numbers released by the state there is one case of COVID-19 confirmed in Knox County as of 3 p.m. EDT.

City parks will remain open. Senior centers were directed to close by the end of the day on Monday.

Kincannon made the announcement during a joint press conference with Knox County and East Tennessee health and hospital leaders. Knox County Health Department Executive Director Dr. Martha Buchanan was also present at the press conference.

Some other key takeaways from the press conference:

If you are sick please do not come to the hospital unannounced. Hospitals need to do everything they can to keep their teams and other patients healthy.

If you’re not sick you don’t need to be tested. You should always start with your doctor. Call them first.

Call first. Call first to determine the best level of care. There will be facilities set up in the near future.

Testing: Knox County just started testing regularly in this community late last week. It’s not everywhere. It’s ramping up and getting established. There’s some variability in where it’s available. We are testing a limited number of people.

Senior Centers: All senior centers will be shut down effective Monday. They will not be open tomorrow.

Restaurants: All restaurants are encouraged to use takeout and delivery services, limit seating to 50% capacity and separate any occupied tables by at least 6 feet.

“We have to keep in mind that we have to balance what we’re doing with ensuring public safety,” Jacobs said. “People have jobs. This will be a huge hit to our economy. We also have to keep in mind what is happening to the economy.”

Jacobs also issued a statement later Monday afternoon regarding COVID-19:

Dr. Buchanan also said at the press conference that there is a partial activation of the emergency operations center, which can also be activated for health crises. The city is working through the operations center to address people’s concerns.

Currently, Knox County and Knoxville leaders are encouraging people to stay at home and practice social distancing.

In regards to planning for the next steps, Mayor Kincannon said, “My mantra is ‘prepared not scared.’ Act in a way that protects public health. Public health is paramount. Act now; it does flatten the curve.”

Flattening the Curve

(source: CDC)

So, what does “flattening the curve” mean in regards to the novel coronavirus?

According to ABC News, flattening the curve is essentially introducing interventions such as social distancing, hand-washing, and lockdowns to reduce the potential spread of infection. The U.S. can flatten the curve before reaching peak case numbers similar to those other countries.

Measures that we all can voluntarily engage in, such as social distancing and hand-washing can have a tremendous impact, potentially negating the need for more aggressive measures such as a lockdown.

“Madison County takes aggressive steps to contain the COVID-19 virus, including the restriction of public gatherings, bars and nightclubs,” Madison County Mayor Jimmy Harris said.

The announcement means Madison County can now take action officials deem necessary to ensure the health and safety of residents, employees and visitors.

As part of the announcement, Harris said restaurants and other businesses that sell food will need to operate at half their seating capacity, and bars will need to close.

“I declare and order in all unincorporated areas of Madison County, any bar or night club or other business establishment which derives more than 50 percent of its revenue from the sale of alcohol on the premises consumption, shall be closed,” Mayor Harris said.

That announcement comes only a day after the City of Jackson made the same call, closing bars and nightclubs and asking that all restaurants serve half the capacity of their businesses and limit the number of people inside businesses to no more than 100.

Harris also said that any person who violates the order will be cited for a misdemeanor violation.

Officials say it’s important to continue practicing the act of social distancing, as well as washing your hands to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“The main focus of this is to protect the health of our community, and it’s going to take all of us being a part of that solution in doing what we have been advised and recommended to do by health officials,” Mayor Harris said.

A state of emergency has been declared for Montgomery County over the coronavirus outbreak.

County Mayor Jim Durrett declared the state of local emergency Tuesday afternoon, giving the county the ability to waive procedures relative to “performance of public works and taking whatever prudent action is necessary to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the community,” according to a news release.

The Clarksville City Council will take up a resolution to declare a city state of emergency in a special called meeting on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in council chambers.

“What this would do is give me latitude on purchasing matters in the state of emergency, and also making sure our city employees are taken care of,” City Mayor Joe Pitts told The Leaf-Chronicle.

As of 2 p.m. Tuesday, there were still no reported cases of COVID-19 in Montgomery County, but the total number had risen to 73 cases statewide, up from 52 on Monday, mostly in Davidson and Williamson counties.

Limiting access to county buildings

Durrett has advised all constitutional officers and county department heads that public access to county facilities will be limited, beginning Thursday, March 19, through Friday, April 3. County offices will remain staffed, the release said.

Residents are encouraged to take advantage of online service options that Montgomery County offers at mcgtn.net.

All county departments have been directed to minimize staffing and create work shifts that separate supervisors and key department personnel. Shifts will work for one week at a time in the office/facility while the other shifts work to answer calls and emails from home.

The work environment will be cleaned prior to the next team rotating into the county facility. Employees who are sick have been directed to stay home and follow the CDC guidelines in seeking medical attention.

“This decision is not based on panic or fear but is a proactive step to ‘flattening the curve’ of this disease. I would rather be accused of over-reacting for the safety of our community than looking back in retrospect wishing I would have done more to protect the citizens of Montgomery County,” Durrett said.

What about local businesses?

“I am also requesting that the citizens and businesses of Montgomery County follow our lead and take proactive steps to prevent the spread of this virus. I realize taking some of these steps will be very difficult and, in some cases, may cause financial loss. Unfortunately, if we do not make changes, the long-term risk is likely to be much more costly,” Durrett said.

Many small businesses, including the food service industry, have or are formulating provisions for drive-through or pick-up options. Citizens are encouraged to continue patronizing all businesses in a way that minimizes social contact, the release said.

Durrett encouraged people to help each other whenever possible.

“If you are well enough and conditions require you to stay at home and a neighbor is working; please volunteer to do things like; mow their lawn, haul their garbage (wear protective gloves), pick up groceries or help in whatever way you can. Together, we will get through this.”

Public meetings

As for normal monthly meetings of commissioners, Durrett told The Leaf-Chronicle there is still much to be ironed out.

“We’re looking at asking our legislators to consider looking at legislation to enable us to post a call-in number for the public to use without having to attend our commission meetings in person through this period, and in a way that satisfies the intent of the open meeting law, but there’s nothing definite on that.

“In the meantime we’re looking at possibly cancelling a lot of our committee meetings and channeling all of their conversations through the Budget Committee, and again at the same time meet the intent of the open meetings law,” Durrett said. “But nothing has been firmed up on any of that.”

The city council meets in monthly executive session on Thursday, March 26, and Pitts isn’t relishing the thought of having Council chambers full of officials and guests with a coronavirus outbreak on everyone’s mind.

“State law requires that we can’t do telephonic meetings unless that rule is suspended, so we’ll have our meeting and try to limit the crowds as best we can,” Pitts said.

CDC guidelines

Durrett urged following the guidelines been set forth by the CDC:

1. Listen to and follow the directions of your state and local authorities.

2. If you feel sick, stay home. Do not go to work. Contact your medical provider.

3. If your children are sick, keep them at home. Do not send them to school or daycare. Contact your medical provider.

4. If someone in your household has tested positive for the coronavirus, keep the entire household at home. Do not go to work. Do not go to school. Contact your medical provider.

5. If you are an older adult, stay home and away from other people.

6. If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lung or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.

7. Even if you are young, or otherwise healthy, you are at risk and your activities can increase the risk for others. It is critical that you do your part to stop the spread of the coronavirus:

Work or engage in schooling from home whenever possible.

If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule. You and your employers should follow CDC guidance to protect your health at work.

Avoid social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.

Avoid eating or drinking in bars, restaurants, and food courts – use drive-thru, pickup, or delivery options.

Avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips, and social visits.

Do not visit nursing homes or retirement or long-term care facilities unless to provide critical assistance.

8. Practice good hygiene:

Wash your hands, especially after touching any frequently used item or surface.

Avoid touching your face.

Sneeze or cough into a tissue, or the inside of your elbow.

Disinfect frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible.

One case of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported in Robertson County as of Wednesday. That’s one of 98 cases detected statewide, according to the Tennessee Department of Health.

The first case was detected in Tennessee earlier this month. Gov. Bill Lee declared a state of emergency in Tennessee on March 12, followed by President Donald Trump's declaration of a national state of emergency on March 13.

The state of emergency in Robertson County allows officials to suspend policies and request mutual aid help from other agencies, according to a Robertson County Emergency Management Agency news release issued Wednesday night.

Robertson County government buildings will limit access to the public through April 1 and will only conduct essential business. Robertson County Detention Facility inmate visitations will still be permitted because of its “non-contact video visitation system.”

The Robertson County Schools district, which announced Wednesday it would close through March 31, will provide meals for local children beginning March 23. Robertson County residents can find more information on the school district's website, according to the release. The school website is at www.rcstn.net.

Officials urged residents to use takeout or delivery services rather than dining in at local restaurants and avoid “taking drastic measures” in purchasing groceries. They also noted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, including staying at home, avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people, washing hands and frequently disinfecting surfaces, among others.

“The next 14 days are critical and citizens must do what they can to flatten the curve, such as staying home if you can and not shaking hands,” the release states.

Though closed, the library will offer curbside service for holds placed online. The veterans service office will close to home visits. Officials encourage citizens to conduct any government services over the phone, according to the release.

""We've had our problems with the CDC, and how they've handled things, and we're not very appreciative of it, about putting our people at risk,"" said Wolff.

An individual was released from quarantine at a local healthcare facility on Saturday, had contact with others, and returned to isolation after a pending lab test came back positive for coronavirus.

""We're doing this out of a sense of caution. We e don't know a lot about this disease,"" said Wolff.

In his issuance, Wolff declared ""that ingress into and travel throughout Bexar County and the remaining 26 municipalities from Lackland by those persons that have been quarantined in the facility is not permitted.""

""They need to have someone pick them up and take them out just as they brought them here, and not expose our population to any potential problem,"" said Wolff.

The public health emergency went into effect immediately following the declaration and will continue for up to seven days unless continued or renewed by the Bexar County Commissioners Court.

Earlier Monday, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg declared a ""local state of disaster and a public health emergency"" over concerns about the potential spread of coronavirus.

""Regardless of what the federal and state governments do, at the local level, we're going to do everything within our power to protect the public,"" said Nirenberg.

Nirenberg's declaration activates the city's emergency management plan and authorizes the city to ""commandeer or use any private property, temporarily acquire, by lease or other means, sites required for temporary housing units or emergency shelters for evacuees, subject to compensation requirements.""

""Our guidance from the medical community and what we've seen from medical professionals throughout the world, really is that we need to ensure that additional testing is done and that the quarantine period may need to last longer,"" said Nirenberg. ""These are Americans. We've been treating them and dealing with the situation in an extraordinary way, a compassionate way, and we also are going to deal with it in a safe way, because that's our obligation to the public.""

It also allows the city to ""take any actions necessary to promote health and suppress disease, including quarantine, examining and regulating hospitals, (and) regulating ingress and egress from the city.""

The declaration concludes by saying that ""no previously quarantined person shall be permitted to enter the City of San Antonio until further notice.""

On February 18, Wolff sent a letter to Congressman Chip Roy, asking that people quarantined for the coronavirus be tested at JBSA-Lackland rather than area hospitals. The judge later joined Mayor Nirenberg in issuing a joint letter pushing to keep the disease from going around San Antonio. The city leaders want to make sure evacuees stay under quarantine at JBSA-Lackland until it's confirmed they have the coronavirus.

""We have asked over and over not to transport these people into the city of San Antonio. They're not citizens of San Antonio, they're not citizens of Bexar County. We've asked them not to do that. They have totally ignored that,"" said Wolff.

Both Wolff and Nirenberg said that although the risk still remains low for the public, the emergency declarations are about being prepared.

""We're doing that with the guidance of our medical community so that people don't have to be concerned about going into the public. So people don't have to be concerned about visiting our city. We want to make sure that the risk of exposure remains low. And so we're going to utilize all of our authority to do that,"" said Nirenberg.

March 2, 2020

DECLARATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY



WHEREAS, as Bexar County Judge, I recently expressed my concerns regarding evacuees, inappropriate accommodations, and the risk of exposure during transport and the need for additional monitoring as well as the need for extended quarantine periods;

WHEREAS, on February 18th, I issued a letter to representatives of the federal government expressing my concerns and on February 24th, joined the Mayor of San Antonio in issuing a joint letter expressing the same and asked that no individual testing positive while at Lackland be transported into the Bexar County community. To date, no response or even an acknowledgement of those concerns has been received and an individual was transported into the community who had tested positive; and

WHEREAS, of even date of this declaration of a local state of disaster on behalf of Bexar County, the Mayor of the City of San Antonio has issued a Declaration of Public Health Emergency; and

WHEREAS, in an abundance of caution, and to protect the unincorporated areas of Bexar County and the remaining 26 municipalities contained within Bexar County, I, Nelson W. Wolff am issuing this declaration of public health emergency pursuant to the authority granted to me under the Texas Disaster Act of 1975; and

WHEREAS, Bexar County will continue to work collaboratively with the Mayor of the City of San Antonio, Bexar County employees as well as the local health authority to ensure that all appropriate measures are undertaken to limit the spread of COVID-19; and

WHEREAS, to date, ten (10) persons evacuated to Lackland have tested positive for the virus and that number is likely to increase, as testing continues; and

WHEREAS, on Saturday, February 29, 2020, one of the persons in Cohort 1 who had tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently tested negative on two tests was released from quarantine. However, this person tested positive for the virus on a third test, with results coming in after release and may have potentially exposed the public to the virus; and

WHEREAS, the person has been returned to quarantine at Lackland while the CDC and local health authorities are taking steps to ensure the community is kept safe and the exposure risk is minimized; and

WHEREAS, it is necessary to the preserve and protect the public health of the residents of Bexar County that those quarantined persons at Lackland remain within the confines of those safe, secure facilities during the quarantine period following their exposure to the virus; and

WHEREAS, following the release of the person from Cohort 1 and positive test after that release, the imminent movement of those quarantined at Lackland by the CDC to other facilities within the Bexar County, including transport to the airports within Bexar County for travel to other secure locations, increases the risks to the residents of Bexar County, creates a public health threat, and requires the County to mitigate the risk of disease and manage the concerns of residents in and around Bexar County; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Texas Disaster Act of 1975, the County Judge may declare a local state of disaster in and for the County, and may exercise the powers granted therein on an appropriate local scale; and

WHEREAS, a declaration of local disaster and public health emergency includes the ability to reduce the possibility of exposure to disease, control the risk, promote health, compel persons to undergo additional health measures that prevent or control the spread of disease, including isolation, surveillance, quarantine, or placement of persons under public health observation, including the provision of temporary housing or emergency shelters for persons misplaced or evacuated and request assistance from the governor of state resources; and

WHEREAS, by this declaration, I declare all rules and regulations that may inhibit or prevent prompt response to this threat suspended for the duration of the incident; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to the County Judge under the Texas Disaster Act of 1975, I authorize the use of all available resources of state government and political subdivisions to assist in the County’s response to this situation; and

WHEREAS, I, Nelson W. Wolff, the County Judge and presiding officer of Bexar County, have determined that in order to remain consistent with the Declaration of Public Health Emergency issued by the City of San Antonio, extraordinary and immediate measures must be taken to respond quickly, prevent and alleviate the suffering of people exposed to and those infected with the virus, as well as those that could potentially be infected or impacted by COVID-19 throughout Bexar County and within the remaining 26 municipal jurisdictions in Bexar County;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT DECLARED BY THE COUNTY JUDGE OF THE COUNTY OF BEXAR:

That a local state of disaster and public health emergency is hereby declared throughout Bexar County pursuant to §418.108(a) of the Texas Government Code.

Federal, state, county and local governments throughout Texas have declared states of emergency and disaster over the last week in response to the growing outbreak of the coronavirus.

As of Tuesday night, there were now more than 4,200 confirmed cases in the United States, up from roughly 1,700 cases on Friday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

President Donald Trump declared the outbreak a national emergency on Friday, saying it will allow the federal government to be far more aggressive with its response to the outbreak, including greatly expanding the availability of testing.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also declared a state of disaster for all counties throughout the state on Friday.

On Tuesday, Caldwell County Judge Hoppy Haden amended a local state of disaster declaration issued the day before. The new declaration, which will last for 21 days, bars gatherings of more than 50 people.

“Due to some of the developments that have gone on over the last two or three days, and really all weekend, I have decided to ask commissioners to reduce the amount of people for mass gatherings,” said Haden, noting the order referred to social gatherings, planned or spontaneous, which would include restaurants, bars, churches and other areas where groups meet socially.

The order does not extend to grocery stores or places of employment that don’t provide venues or opportunities for social gatherings.

Haden said the declaration applies to all areas in the county, both incorporated and unincorporated, but noted cities within the county had the option to enact stricter regulations if they deemed it necessary.

Violation of the order is punishable as a Class C misdemeanor by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or 180 days in jail.

Haden said there were still no confirmed cases in Caldwell County, noting officials are closely monitoring the situation and will alter the stipulations of the disaster declaration prior to the end of the 21-day period, if needed.

At Tuesday night’s city council meeting, Lockhart Mayor Lew White instituted similar restrictions throughout the city.

“Due to the recent concerns over the coronavirus spread, several communities have begun the process of declaring local states of disaster,” said White. “I’m issuing that declaration on behalf of the city tonight.

“This declaration is not issued lightly. It’s issued in conjunction and in recognition of the action recently taken by the county in protection of its citizens and in the interest of the general public health.”

White noted the declaration bars all gatherings of 50 or more people.

“A gathering generally refers to a scheduled event or common endeavor where 50 people are present in a confined space, room or area,” said White. “The limitation on the size of gatherings shall extend to commercial, retail, wholesale, industrial, service, eating and entertainment establishments, with the exception of grocery stores.

“The representatives of such establishments shall be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the limitation on the size of the gatherings.”

The order does not extend to grocery stores or places of employment that don’t provide venues or opportunities for social gatherings.

Violation of the order is punishable as a Class C misdemeanor by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or 180 days in jail.

White noted the declaration will last for seven days. The city will call a special meeting on Tuesday of next week to determine whether the declaration should be extended and will continue to do so each week as needed.

“This requirement on the number of people may change if we start to the reporting of Covid-19 cases in Caldwell County, but as was reported today, there are none,” White said. “We do this in consideration of the public health, and we try to limit as much as we can the effect, especially on small businesses.”

While there have still been no confirmed cases in Caldwell County, Austin and Travis County officials confirmed the first two “presumptive cases” of the virus in the area on Friday, marking the county’s closest encounter to virus yet. The cases are considered presumptive after testing positive by state officials. They are then sent to the Centers for Disease Control for final confirmation.

Lockhart officials have reminded residents they have the option to pay bills online and at drop-off locations to limit face-to-face contact. The online payment option can be found at http://lockhart-tx.org/page/utility_home.

Two centrally located drop boxes are located at the front and back of City Hall — 308 W. San Antonio – and are checked twice a day. A drive-through location can be found at the Municipal Court Building, 1914 W. San Antonio St.

To mitigate risks associated with large crowds, Lockhart officials canceled all the spring break events scheduled at the Dr. Eugene Clark Library through March 31 and has indefinitely postponed the KIDFISH and Welcome Spring Day event that was scheduled for March 21.

Lockhart City Manager Steve Lewis added that Lockhart Senior Center is closed but is still providing meals through delivery. The food bank will still remain open, but only be appoint.

Lewis added, while not official, it appears likely the upcoming Lone Star Grand Prix kart racing will likely be pushed back to next year.

According to Lewis, the Lockhart Police Department has been taking some police reports by phone to limit face-to-face interactions when not necessary.

“If it’s not time sensitive or a critical emergency, we’re trying to do things over the phone,” he said.

During his address, Gov. Abbott told Texans on Friday there was no need to hoard or panic-buy supplies, though many stores in Lockhart have seen bare shelves.

To address the issue, HEB officials announced Saturday morning that stores throughout the state would be opening at 8 a.m. and closing at 8 p.m. to give overnight crews more time to restock important items associated with hindering the spread of the virus.

On Friday, HEB officials issued a press release stating the company was still in a strong position to restock shelves and encouraged customers to remain calm.

Wal-Mart stores throughout the country are taking similar measures, changing hours of operation nationwide to 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. to give staff members additional time to restock.

The city and county of El Paso have declared a state of emergency over concerns about coronavirus spreading throughout the world.

The declarations take effect immediately and were signed today by County Judge Ricardo Samaniego and mayor Dee Margo.

""We really want you to understand that the panic is not going to help,"" County Judge Ricardo Samaniego said. ""Our goal is not to close down anything but to be able to have a continuation of operations in the best possible way.""

El Paso does not have any confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Community members with concerns or questions can dial 211 for information.

Margo said the city and county are following the federal and state government's decisions to call for a state of emergency. The World Health Organization announced the spread of COVID-19, also commonly called the coronavirus, had become a pandemic.

""(The emergency declaration) opens the door for resources that would normally not be available to address concerns such as funding and restrictions on gatherings,"" Margo said.

Margo and Samaniego made Friday's announcement after using a section in Texas' government code that allows for a ""Declaration of Local Disaster"" due to a public health emergency. It is meant to help reduce the possibility of exposure to disease as well as control risks and prevent the spread of the virus.

""There is no need to panic,"" Margo said. ""There is no need to hoard. There is no need to go out and buy water or toilet paper or all the things that have been reported.""

The state of emergency lasts for seven days and requires a City Council vote to continue. It also activates emergency protocols and teams to respond to the rising concern over the virus.

The declaration allows for the city to adopt rules to protect its residents and declare ""quarantine stations,"" and emergency hospitals.

Under the declaration, the mayor is allowed to initiate directives to protect lives in the city. Members of the public are not being prohibited from participating in council meetings, and residents interested in staying away from rooms with large groups of people can participate by phone or online.

A threat assessment group, composed of regional agencies in the U.S. and Mexico, have met daily to share communications and information.

""As a region we've been meeting, discussing and preparing the city of El Paso along with our public and private partners such as the county of El Paso,"" Margo said. ""We are in total alignment. Our declarations are in total alignment. And, this is a joint city-county effort.""

Samaniego said a task force has been created internally to ensure the safety of employees, including sick leave. Employees with health issues should respond ""appropriately,"" he said.

County officials say the office of court administration has called for the postponement of jury trials and other county related activities have been suspended, including travel.

Hector Ocaranza with the Department of Public Health said residents can dial 211 with any questions they have about the virus. Ocaranza said protocols are being developed to ensure that elderly and individuals with chronic illnesses are safe.

He said four people have been tested in the area by the public health department. Guidance from the Center for Disease Control and the state provide guidelines for the department of health to determine who is tested, he said.

A physician has to recommend a person be reviewed for the coronavirus, Ocaranza said.

David Coronado, director of the city's International Bridges Department, said ports of entry remain open and his office is in contact with Customs and Border Protection.

The illness is a novel coronavirus first detected in China, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Jan. 30, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared an outbreak of the illness to be a public health emergency of international concern.

Data compounded by Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering on the city's public health department website says there have been a confirmed 137,445 cases worldwide. The data show 69,779 people have recovered from the illness and 5,088 have died from it.

In the U.S. there have been 1,268 confirmed cases, according to the data.

Fannin County declares state of emergency to slow spread of COVID-19

By Allen Rich

Mar 18, 2020

Fannin County, Texas -- At 8:55 a.m. Tuesday, March 17, 2020, Fannin County joined the growing list of cities and counties that have formally declared a state of emergency in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus.

In spite of pleas from everyone from President Donald Trump to Fannin County Judge Randy Moore asking non-essential personnel to do their part by avoiding large gatherings, approximately 50 residents attended the meeting at Bonham City Hall.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson declared a state of emergency Thursday, March 12 and Texas Governor Greg Abbott followed suit on Friday, declaring a state of emergency in all 254 counties.

Also on Friday, President Donald Trump announced that he was declaring the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency.

On Monday, Collin County Judge Chris Hill proclaimed that COVID-19 poses an immanent threat of disaster to Collin County, Grayson County announced a formal disaster declaration, and McKinney Mayor George Fuller declared a local state of disaster for the public health emergency related to the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19).

On Tuesday, March 17, 2020, Fannin County and the City of Bonham joined this list of local entities declaring an emergency in hopes of slowing the spread of COVID-19.

PROCLAMATION

Fannin County Judge Randy Moore

WHEREAS, the novel coronavirus now designated SARS-CoV-2 which causes the disease COVID-19, has spread through the world and has now been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization; and

WHEREAS, President Donald Trump has proclaimed the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency in the United States; and Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of disaster for all counties in Texas; and

WHEREAS, Fannin County has already taken significant measures to prepare for and prevent the spread of COVID-19; and

WHEREAS, it is critical to take additional steps to prepare for, respond to, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 to protect the health and welfare of Fannin County citizens; and

WHEREAS, declaring a state of disaster in Fannin County will facilitate and expedite the procurement, use, and deployment of resources to enhance preparedness and response.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, Randy Moore, County Judge of Fannin County, Texas, do hereby certify that COVID-19 poses an imminent threat of disaster to Fannin County. In accordance with Section 418.018 of the Texas Government Code, I hereby declare a state of disaster and public health emergency for Fannin County.

"426","Texas","Jack","https://www.jacksboronewspapers.com/covid-19-news-jacksboro/jack-county-city-jacksboro-declare-emergencies","Jack County, City of Jacksboro declare emergencies","Jack County Judge Keith Umphress made a declaration of local readiness for a public health emergency on Monday afternoon while the Jacksboro city council declared a local disaster for public health emergency and order during their meeting in the same evening amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The declaration from the judge states extraordinary measures must be taken to contain the novel virus and prevent its spread.

The declaration from Umphress declares a state of emergency for the county and the implementation of the county’s emergency plan for seven days. It does not add any further restrictions to businesses or residents.

Umphress shared scripture from 2 Timothy 1:7 on Facebook when he posted the declaration.

“For God will never give you the spirit of fear, but the Holy Spirit who give you mighty power, love and self-control,” the post read.

The Jack County Commissioner’s Court is set to meet on Monday, March 30, to ratify the declaration for a longer period of time.

Mayor Alton Morris serves as the emergency management authority for the city while Jacksboro Fire Department Chief Jeremy Jennings serves as the emergency management coordinator for the city of Jacksboro.

“Because this is a medical emergency then the one who would kick-off any type of emergency management plan would be the local health authority, (Dr. Robert Cooper,)” City Manager Mike Smith said.

The council weighed two options in which the Mayor alone could have declared an emergency that only lasts seven days or the council could declare a state of emergency for an indefinite amount of time.

The council ultimately decided to declare a state of emergency as a whole and the declaration will remain in effect until discontinued.

“The fact that Judge Umphress declared an emergency for the county, it covers the city, he has that authority,” Smith said. “However, if the city does not declare an emergency we will not be eligible for any federal or state funds that might come along to help us pay for anything we need to as a result of this emergency.”

The city manager said city hall will be locked to the public except by appointment, but they are still going to be accepting payments, although the public is encouraged to pay online if possible. Twin Lakes Activity Center will also be closed as part of the declaration.

Smith will be authorized to take necessary action regarding fees associated with utility billing including extending time for payment and suspending utility shut offs for customers negatively impacted by job loss or reduced income due to COVID-19 with documentation.

Smith said the police department can fine any violators up to $1,000 or place them in jail for up to 180 days, but he does not foresee those measures needing to be taken.

“We’re certainly not going to go out and start arresting people or writing citations because they are eating at JR’s,” Smith said. “I think for the most part we have seen people are policing themselves when it comes to that. But, certainly it gives us this ability to take some action should there be something really extreme happen.”

He added the declaration does not add anymore restrictions to businesses and activities in town than what has already been placed by Governor Gregg Abbott and President Donald Trump.

Abbot declared a public health disaster for the state of Texas on March 19 to last through Friday, April 3.

The executive order contains four parts: 1. Every person in Texas shall avoid social gatherings and groups more than 10; 2. People shall avoid eating and drinking in bars and restaurants, in food courts or visiting gyms; 3. People shall not visit nursing homes, retirement centers or long-term care facilities, unless to provide critical assistance; 4. All schools in the state of Texas shall be temporarily closed.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported there has been a total of 54,453 COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, cases in the United States resulting in 737 deaths. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported a total of 715 cases and 11 deaths in the state.

According to the CDC, steps which residents can take to help prevent the spread of the virus including washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoiding contact with their faces, avoiding contact with people who are sick, staying home when sick, covering a cough or sneeze with a tissue and disposing of the tissue in the trash and by cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.",8957,2020-03-27

Knox County Commissioners announced the local health emergency on Wednesday.

They said this will give the health department and the county more tools to fight COVID-19.

There are no confirmed cases in Knox County. This is something health officials emphasized in the press conference.

Commissioner Kelly Streeter said the health emergency declaration comes with an abundance of caution. The hope is this declaration will help the county stay on top of the pandemic.

Health leaders will have more ability to take actions dealing with the virus.

For example - the health department can now shut down a business that is not in compliance with COVID-19 restrictions.

Commissioners say it will also help with funding if the coronavirus makes it to Knox County.

Streeter says it is important to note they want to make sure everyone is safe.

""We really don't want to infringe on anybody's rights...but we just ask, let's help one another and let's do what is best to make sure that we get through this and our community is still intact as well as our businesses and our government,"" Streeter said.

Restrictions on restaurants, bars, gyms and public gatherings spread beyond Waco on Wednesday as McLennan County and suburban cities declared states of emergency in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lorena, Hewitt, Robinson and the county passed declarations Wednesday, taking effect at 11:59 p.m. that day.

Hewitt and Lorena will close indoor recreation facilities like bowling alleys, gyms, bars and private clubs while limiting restaurants to to-go service and delivery. The cities of Waco and Lacy Lakeview adopted similar restrictions Tuesday, and Bellmead on Wednesday amended an earlier declaration to follow suit, taking effect immediately.

Robinson, Woodway and the county have opted to only limit the seating capacities of dining rooms. All have prohibited public and private gatherings of 50 people or more.

McLennan County Judge Scott Felton declared a local state of disaster and public health emergency for McLennan County, enacting restrictions that will apply to unincorporated areas. Under the restrictions, the capacity of indoor recreation facilities, bars, clubs and restaurants will be limited to either 50% of their capacity or 50 people, whichever is less. The declaration also prohibits events that bring together more than 50 people.

During a special meeting, the county noted that municipalities such as Waco retain authority over their domains.

McLennan County Judge Scott Felton said he had been in discussions with city managers in the area, and with a few restaurant owners, to get their feel of the situation.

Precinct 4 Commissioner Ben Perry mentioned he stopped at a small restaurant on his way to the courthouse, and there were as many people standing in line to retrieve their call-in orders as could have been seated in the dining area, so “mingling” is inevitable.

Perry said he counted 13 restaurants, most very small, operating within the county’s unincorporated area that would be impacted by the county’s emergency declaration.

Coronavirus latest: What's happening around Waco The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in McLennan County increased by three on Saturday, March 21, bringing the total to 16.

Hewitt made its declaration Wednesday morning. City Manager Bo Thomas said the state of emergency will last seven days, at which point city council and the mayor will meet and vote whether to extend it.

The decision came after Waco-McLennan County Public Health District announced five people in McLennan County had tested positive for COVID-19, a number that grew to six by day’s end.

“There’s a possibility there might be a person who works in Hewitt that may be one of those affected people,” Thomas said.

Angelia Sloan, city secretary for McGregor, said city officials will follow the rules outlined by the county and have not enacted more stringent policies.

Woodway declared a “local disaster emergency” on Wednesday. While the order won’t shutter restaurants, City Manager Shawn Oubre said most restaurants in town have voluntarily moved to takeout service only. The two restaurants that will keep their dining rooms open will limit their seating capacity to 50 people.

“I told them to help us, don’t let it get too crowded,” Oubre. “We don’t have big restaurants here, most of them won’t even sit 50 people.”

Oubre said Woodway is also canceling events booked at city facilities for the next 60 days and refunding deposits.

“Although this disease has not yet peaked for our area, state, or county, we must be vigilant and take care of one another. We are working diligently to slow the spread of COVID-19 in McLennan County and this declaration will provide necessary measures to do so,” a city press release stated.

The city of Robinson’s declaration limits the number of dine-in customers allowed in a restaurant to either 50 people or half of the restaurant’s occupancy limit. Indoor gyms and pools will close, along with the city’s community center, senior center, municipal court and Peplow Park.

The city of West has not yet declared an emergency, but closed its park, West Public Library, Little League fields, City Hall and West Community Center Wednesday. The West City Hall lobby will be closed to the public but staff will still be available to answer phone calls at (254) 826-5351, and process payments over the phone or online at www.payclix.com/cityofwest. The city also reinstated a juvenile curfew, prohibiting anyone 16 years old or younger from being out in public from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

UINTAH COUNTY, Utah (ABC4 News) — Uintah County Commission Chairman Brad Horrocks signed a proclamation declaring a local state of emergency due to the negative economic impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on county residents.

“I have been speaking daily with business owners, hotel managers and others in our county,” the chairman said. “Some are already suffering significant economic losses brought on by the efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and there’s no concrete timeline for when that might change.”

According to a release, Horrocks said the emergency declaration is an important first step towards assisting businesses and residents during uncertain times. It allows the county to provide applications for financial aid to local businesses, organizations, and families through agencies like Small Business Administration.

In addition, the proclamation allows the county to request and receive disaster assistance and mutual aid from the state and federal government if it becomes necessary.

Currently, Uintah County has no confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to TriCounty Health Department. There are currently 112 known cases of the virus in Utah.

Accomack County officials declared a state of emergency in the county Thursday, March 19, after the Eastern Shore Health District announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

The Board of Supervisors met Friday via teleconference to ratify the emergency declaration made the day before by the Director of Emergency Management.

Chairwoman Reneta Major offered an invocation at the start of the emergency meeting, asking God to give the board of supervisors and staff “wisdom in this perilous time,” and to “intervene on our behalf.”

“We ask that you heal the land, God — only You can,” she said.

Accomack County Administrator Michael Mason said the ordinance to be approved was “substantially similar to some other jurisdictions out there that have adopted one.”

“We have to be able to continue government without having a typical quorum of the governing body present to conduct business,” said Cela Burge, Accomack County attorney.

The county is still subject to recording meetings, keeping minutes, and other requirements, including under the Freedom in Information Act, according to Burge.

Procedures adopted by the board of supervisors to ensure continuity of local government during the COVID-19 emergency include:

Meetings of the board of supervisors and other local boards and commissions may be held through electronic means, without a quorum of members physically present in a single location.

Any matter that requires the physical presence of the public in a county building that is closed to the public has been suspended.

County meetings may be held without the public being physically present, as long as alternative arrangement for public access is made, such as audio, video or telephone broadcast.

Where a public hearing is required by law, public comment will be solicited and received by written means before a vote, or may be solicited and received by electronic and telephone means, if it is practical and possible. Those comments will be provided to members of the board or commission and will be made part of the official record of the meeting.

The emergency provisions are to remain in effect until the board of supervisors repeals them, for no more than six months.

Additionally, all Accomack County facilities and offices, including the Commissioner of the Revenue’s Office, the Voter Registrar’s Office, Parks and Recreation, and the Treasurer’s Office are closed to the public starting Friday, March 20, and will remain closed until further notice. “We don’t take this decision lightly, but we’re following the recommendations of the governor and state health officials about limiting public gatherings to no more than 10 and practicing social distancing,” the county announced in a press release.

No in-person transactions will be conducted.

All county employees will continue to report to work during their normal work hours. The public is encouraged to use the county’s online options for payments and services as the majority of transactions and services can be conducted in ways other than face-to-face.

Visit https://www.co.accomack.va.us.

For assistance, please call during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.–5 p.m.) at (757) 787-5700.

Additional information regarding options for conducting transactions with specific departments can be found on the county website, and at the entrance to the administrative offices on Courthouse Avenue. Landfill, transfer stations and convenience centers will continue to operate, but with limited interaction between staff and public.

All county-sponsored or supported events and activities are canceled until further notice. The decision to modify county operations follows the governor’s emergency declaration, CDC recommendations and the ever-evolving COVID-19 situation.

“We already have quite a few people telecommuting as of today…This is a very fluid situation,” Mason said of county staff.

“The public has been very understanding, and we will continue to adapt as we need to,” he said.

Major urged Accomack County residents to stay home for the time being.

“We can strongly encourage our citizens to stay put within our own jurisdictions. I know sometimes it’s tempting to go…Our citizens need to understand they need to understand, they need to stay within Accomack or Northampton county. I don’t think we need to be venturing out too much.”",33148,2020-03-23

The declaration allows county or city officials to make decisions quickly about emergency actions that might be needed to help protect county residents and to allocate local resources where needed.

It also allows the county or city to access operational resources and funding from state and federal agencies. The President declared a national state of emergency on March 13, 2020, and Governor Northam declared a state of emergency for the Commonwealth of Virginia on March 12.

Augusta County leaders say they've been coordinating closely with Waynesboro and Staunton leaders to share information and resources.

The moves by Augusta County and Staunton follow Harrisonburg's declaration over the weekend.

While there has been one positive test for COVID-19 in a Harrisonburg patient and one positive test across the mountain in Charlottesville among the UVA community, at this point, there have been no confirmed cases in Augusta County, Staunton, or Waynesboro.

However, local governments are making these moves to prevent further spread of the virus and ""flatten the curve"" of transmission.

Below are aspects of the county and the city affected by the declarations:

The local declaration of emergency was issued Thursday and is signed by Carroll County Board of Supervisors’ Chairman Joe N. Webb. Carroll County Interim Administrator Cellell Dalton said the emergency is a precautionary measure going forward that allows the county to access aid and resources, if necessary.

“This allows you to tap into state and federal aid, which is the foremost reason. If you have a local emergency, you can call the state and get resources to your locality if you need them,” Dalton said Thursday. “This is also in preparation in the event, as is typically a requirement in federal government, if we do spend any funds to address this COVID-19 (pandemic). As far as we know from the state health department, we still don’t have any confirmed cases yet.”

Dalton said business continues as usual in the county administrator’s office and most other county agencies inside the Carroll County Governmental Complex.

“People are still walking in. What we are doing is encouraging everybody to follow the governor’s and president’s recommendations to just stay home and stay away the best they can,” Dalton said. “Try to limit your travel and be done with it.”

The declaration of emergency reads as follows:

WHEREAS, in accordance with Virginia Code Section 44-146.21. that gives a local government the ability to declare a state of emergency to protect its citizens from current and potential emergencies: and

WHEREAS, The SARS-CoV02 (COVID-19) has been declared a world pandemic, and is a novel disease that has resulted in death to our most vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immune depressed; and

WHEREAS, Carroll County understands the economic impact that COVID-19 is causing not only on the national stage but the local economy and the risk to its businesses; and

WHEREAS, the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia have declared States of Emergency to protect their citizens, and to get more information out, as well as to move the proper resource to the affected areas; and

WHEREAS, Carroll County reinforces the guidance from the Federal government of reducing exposure by limiting the number of people in a group, using good hygiene and cleaning of high traffic areas, and social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19; and

WHEREAS, Carroll County will continue to monitor the ever-changing situation, implement county plans, and provide information to the public to further mitigate the spread and comfort its citizens from panic that could occur from such an emergency.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY PROCLAIMED, the Carroll County Board of Supervisors declares that Carroll County is under a State of Emergency by the Director of Emergency Management, and the Emergency Operations Plan is now in effect on this 19th day of March, 2020.

If the service you are requesting is determined to require entry to the building, you will be met at the door to the courthouse adjacent to the main parking lot. This action is meant to maximize social distancing, reduce unnecessary public interaction and help to minimize the potential for spread of COVID-19.

Town government facilities in Fries, Independence and Troutdale are taking similar precautions to those of the county.

Public schools remain closed to students. “School officials and staff are continuing to develop extraordinary mechanisms for continuing to educate students while keeping them, their families and the rest of our citizens safe,” the announcement said.

Circuit Court and General District Court hearings have been continued until April 6. This does not include arraignments, bail hearings, protective order appeals or other cases deemed an emergency. Contact the Circuit Court Clerk’s office at (276) 773-2231; or the District Court Clerk’s office at (276) 773-2011.

The Department of Motor Vehicles office in Independence is closed, as well.

“We ask you, the citizens that make Grayson County the wonderful place that it is, to support us in these actions as well as following the recommendations of the Virginia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” the statement said. “We thank each of you for supporting our communities as we continue to prepare.”

Carroll County

The Carroll County Board of Supervisors declared a local emergency during a special called meeting on Thursday, in the wake of increasing outbreaks from COVID-19.

A proclamation issued Thursday afternoon stated that, while Carroll does not have a recorded positive case of the virus, the county “understands the risk and severity of this situation and continues to implement plans and provides information for its citizens to help reduce the exposure and possibly lessen the impact on the community.”

The proclamation also said that the county “understands the economic impact that COVID-19 is causing, not only on the national stage, but the local economy and the risk to its businesses.”

The proclamation continued: “Whereas, the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia have declared states of emergency to protect their citizens, and to get more information out, as well as to move the proper resource to the affected areas... Carroll County reinforces the guidance from the federal government of reducing exposure by limiting the number of people in a group, using good hygiene and cleaning of high traffic areas, and social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19.”

The county will “continue to monitor the ever-changing situation, implement county plans and provide information to the public to further mitigate the spread and comfort its citizens from the panic that could occur from such an emergency.”

Virginia Code 44-146.21 gives local government the ability to declare a state of emergency to protect its citizens from current and potential emergencies.

The Carroll County Supervisors Board Meeting for March 23 will now be held at the County Complex instead of at St. Paul School, as originally planned. County administration is requesting that the public not attend this meeting in order to comply with the governor’s recommendation of no more than 10 people at a gathering. The meeting will be live-streamed via YouTube.",15161,NA

"445","Virginia","Loudoun","https://patch.com/virginia/leesburg/loudoun-declares-local-emergency-help-cope-coronavirus","Loudoun Declares Local Emergency In Response To Coronavirus","LOUDOUN COUNTY, VA — The Loudoun County government declared a local emergency Monday morning in response to the continued spread of the new coronavirus known as COVID-19. Loudoun County Administrator Tim Hemstreet issued the declaration in coordination with Loudoun County Board of Supervisors Chair Phyllis J. Randall.

The Loudoun Board of Supervisors is expected to formally ratify the declaration at its next business meeting scheduled for Tuesday at 5 p.m., the county government said.

The local declaration of emergency relaxes formal procurement requirements to allow Loudoun County to more easily acquire any goods or services needed to assist in the response to the threat posed by the coronavirus. The declaration also modifies normal employment rules so that employees can be reassigned to county operations involved in response activities.

A local declaration of emergency is sometimes a requirement for residents and businesses to obtain financial aid and emergency loans offered by the federal or state governments.



""It is critical that we remove any barriers to the county's ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Randall said in a statement. ""This declaration will give us more flexibility as we respond in the coming days, weeks and months to this public health threat.""

The declaration of a local emergency in Loudoun follows the declaration of a statewide emergency from Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and local declarations from other jurisdictions in the region.

The declaration also follows many steps the county has already taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Last week, Loudoun County schools closed in response to the order from Northam for all schools in Virginia to shut down for two weeks. County libraries, parks and recreation, and senior facilities also have closed down.



Like every jurisdiction across the country, Loudoun County is encouraging residents to take steps to limit the spread of coronavirus, including:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Stay home when you are sick.

Avoid contact with sick people.

Avoid non-essential travel.

According to the Los Angeles Times, officials in the county, which is comprised of more than 30 cities, will hold a press conference discussing the new declaration later in the afternoon.

At least one person in the county has reportedly been infected with the virus, which has killed over a thousand people worldwide and infected victims in various parts of the world.

The move by Orange County to declare a local health emergency reportedly comes after Santa Clara County and San Diego County issued similar alerts earlier this month, in addition to San Francisco.

So far, officials say more than 50 cases of the virus have been reported in the country out of the more than 80,000 cases reported worldwide, according to CNN.

A number of pubic health experts have expressed alarm over the outbreak as some officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say the agency has begun to prepare for the virus to “take a foothold in the US.""

“Right now we're in an aggressive containment mode.” Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, said earlier this month.

Wendi Lane, a health emergency Coordinator for the Rappahannock Area Health District says one person in Stafford County was a presumptive positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.

The Virginia Department of Health is expected to provide more information on that case. RAHD will also be providing a person full-time in the Emergency Operations Center.

This comes as both Stafford County and Fredericksburg City declare states of emergency.

Both jurisdictions have urged their residents to quarantine themselves away from the public in the wake of the spreading coronavirus.

Meetings, public events, and travel by government workers have all been suspended.

In a press release, Stafford County Government tells Potomac Local News that the declaration lifts certain procurement laws to allow the County Administrator to take necessary actions during the declaration, and it provides local small businesses with the ability to apply for loans through the Small Business Administration.

It also gives Stafford County access to state mutual aid. The County’s Emergency Operations Center has been activated since last week and will remain open for as long as required.

“Declaring now puts Stafford in the right position to stay proactive and prepared during this unprecedented circumstance as the wellbeing and safety of our community and staff is our top priority,” states county administrator Tom Foley.

Stafford County has canceled all programs, events, classes, and meetings held at County facilities until March 31, 2020. The Board of Supervisors is currently scheduled to meet on Tuesday, March 17, 2020, at 12:00 p.m. only, and has canceled the 7:00 p.m. meeting along with public hearings. Staff will be monitoring the limit of 50 visitors and implementing social distancing practices.

The Stafford DMV Select, located in the Treasurer’s Office of the George L. Gordon, Jr., Government Center, 1300 Courthouse Road, Stafford has suspended all services from March 17 through April 2, 2020.

Stafford County has implemented a telework policy. The goal is to maximize teleworking and social distancing to protect employees as well as visitors without effecting Stafford’s level of service to citizens.

In Fredericksburg, officials say The declaration was issued as a precautionary security measure, which allows for the full powers of government to deal effectively with emergencies or hazardous weather conditions.

“We understand these measures are unusual and inconvenient to many, but we must look out for the safety and security of our citizens, guests, and employees. Some people may also be frightened or upset by the conditions in these times, but it’s critical that everyone remain calm, stay informed and follow the CDC’s safety guidelines,” said city manager Tim Baroody.

The city says it’s following the guidance and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) to practice social distancing as part of a community mitigation strategy.

Fredericksburg will help with these strategies by:

Canceling all city-sponsored events and activities, including activities managed by the Parks, Recreation and Events Department effective immediately.

Employee work-related travel outside of the City of Fredericksburg, except for essential business, is being restricted until further notice.

The City is taking additional efforts to protect our employees, citizens, and guests by expanding cleaning efforts for all our buildings during the day.

The City will implement a compassionate billing policy for all Utility customers. Until further notice, no customers will have their water or sewer service cut off.

By Jessie Stensland / Whidbey News-Times

By Jessie Stensland / Whidbey News-Times

A run on toilet paper at grocery stores is perhaps the most noticeable visual impact the coronavirus has had on Whidbey Island, but that doesn’t mean a lot of activity isn’t going on behind the scenes.

There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus on Whidbey Island, health officials said late Thursday.

Nonetheless, the Island County commissioners formally declared a state of emergency March 2 for the entire county due to the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, commonly known as the coronavirus. The declaration activates emergency management plans, allows emergency use of local resources and authorizes the use of emergency expenditures.

“This will allow for a more rapid response time in order to assist affected individuals to recover from the outbreak,” a release from the commissioners stated.

The county will also have a public health weekend call center to respond to questions regarding the coronavirus. The call center will be open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on both Saturday, March 7 and Sunday, March 8.

The number to call for information is 360-678-2301.

Erin Woolley, chief nursing officer at WhidbeyHealth Medical Center, said the hospital is prepared to respond to the virus and accompanying challenges. In fact, the hospital employs “an infection preventionist” and the staff trains to respond to all kinds of different health hazards.

“It’s what we do all the time,” she said.

Woolley said the hospital assembled a task force made up of medical professionals, public health staff, emergency management, the Navy and others to plan and prepare. Hospital officials are in daily contact with the Island County Health Department, the state Department of Health and other agencies to keep up to date on what’s happening.

The hospital conducts drills on how to isolate patients and collect specimens. Cleaning efforts have been increased and extra supplies have been ordered. Staff members watch webinars and listen to podcasts about the disease.

The hospital has trained a range of providers and staff on screening questions, which Woolley said is one of the most vital parts of the response.

Woolley explained people shouldn’t expect to see tents set up outside or many of the other visuals from pandemic movies. Even if the coronavirus does spread to Whidbey Island, most people will get only mildly ill and won’t need to be hospitalized.

“But we are certainly prepared if patients require hospitalization,” she said, explaining that the hospital has airborne isolation rooms which are used for other infections.

Doctors and nurses at the hospital aren’t wearing hazmat suits but are following the normal precautions for dealing with people who have respiratory symptoms. Woolley explained that the hospital follows guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control.

In addition, she said the CDC sets the parameters for when patients are tested for coronavirus.

A patient becomes a “person under investigation” and is tested if he or she has certain respiratory symptoms and recently traveled to a country with an outbreak; was in close contact with someone who tested positive; or is hospitalized without a different explanation for the illness.

The swabs may be a little uncomfortable, Woolley cautioned, since they have to go fairly deep into the nose and the back of the throat.

For accurate information about the coronavirus, the hospital advises people to check out the Washington State Department of Health website at www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus, the CDC website at/www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html or and the website for the World Health Organization at /www.who.int/emergen…/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019.

The San Juan County Council will be meeting on Friday, March 13 to declare an emergency in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

By declaring an emergency, San Juan County can fully employ all emergency response plans, utilize county resources and authorize emergency expenditures for the response throughout San Juan County. There will be no restrictions or closures included in the declaration.

“An emergency declaration is another step in our efforts towards ensuring all County resources are available as needed,” said Rick Hughes, Chair of the San Juan County Council.

As of March 12, 2020, there have been no confirmed COVID-19 cases in San Juan County, however, rapid spread throughout Washington state has increased the county’s aggressive planning and preparation work.

Chair Hughes said, “Our County has been working on emergency preparations since January and we have ramped up our efforts as the outbreak has progressed. This is a challenging situation for everyone, and we absolutely appreciate the ongoing spirit and energy of the islands and our citizens in the midst of so much stress and uncertainty.”

A copy of the emergency declaration will be available on the County website once officially approved by Council.

San Juan County health officials continue reminding everyone that if you feel sick and have mild symptoms, stay home.

They are asking people to stay away from groups of 50 or more, to avoid handshakes and to keep at least 6 feet between themselves and others when in public.

""Social distancing can be one of the best ways for us to combat the spread of this virus,"" said Snohomish County Health Officer Dr. Chris Spitters.

Officials are also practicing what they preach. Everett police canceled a Coffee With A Cop event at a downtown Starbucks.

So far, there have been 70 confirmed cases of COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by novel coronavirus, throughout Washington state. Of those cases, 18 of those are in Snohomish County, including the death of one man in his 40s who was a patient at EvergreenHealth.

In Snohomish County, firefighters and other first-responders are being outfitted with gloves, masks and goggles for any calls they receive involving respiratory issues.

Fire officials said seeing a responder with protective gear is no reason for alarm.

Public transit is now being more thoroughly scrubbed. Sanitation stations for hand washing are being set up in government buildings.

Because people older than 60 are especially at risk, senior centers in Lynnwood and Everett have been temporarily shut down as a precaution.

Health officials advised people to call their doctors before showing up at a clinic, and to avoid the emergency department unless they're very sick.

""This will allow our health care workers to remain safe themselves and focus on the most urgent cases more quickly,"" Spitters said. ""All of these precautions are recommended not mandatory. It's really up to the individual at this point.""

The county also encouraged employers to allow people to work from home. The decision to close schools is being left at a district level.

Despite the growing number of cases, and concern Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers said the risk of contracting the disease remains very low.

""The British have a saying, 'Stay calm and carry on,'"" Somers said. ""I think ours should be, 'Keep calm and wash your hands.'""",745913,2020-03-08

A Whatcom County public health emergency has been declared to reduce the spread of novel coronavirus in the community after the county health department announced on Tuesday afternoon, March 10, that the county had its first confirmed case of COVID-19.

The person who tested positive is a woman in her 60s who received medical care at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center.

Her condition improved and she was discharged. Since that time she has been self-isolating at home. She has no known international travel history, the health department announced.

“This positive case confirms that COVID-19 is circulating in our community,” said John Wolpers, an incident commander with the Whatcom County Health Department, in a briefing on Tuesday.

Citing patient privacy laws, health department officials declined to say more about the woman or where in Whatcom County she lives.

In response to the first confirmed case of what also is called the novel coronavirus, Satpal Sidhu, the Whatcom County executive, on Tuesday declared the public health emergency. He did so in coordination with the Whatcom County Health Board.

Declaring an emergency facilitates coordination with local and statewide partners, officials said, adding that it helps them provide a comprehensive Whatcom County response to the outbreak.

On Tuesday, the health department also issued new recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including canceling or postponing non-essential large public gatherings and encouraging businesses to allow their employees to work from home if possible.

It did not, however, recommend school closures although the department noted that decision is up to school districts in Whatcom County.

The Whatcom County Health Department was working aggressively to identify all those who may have come into contact with the woman who had the first confirmed case of COVID-19 here, officials said.

Close contacts may include family members, co-workers, emergency responders and others. Once identified, they will be closely monitored for symptoms to avoid further spread, the health department said.

“We understand that news of this first confirmed case in our community creates fear and uncertainty. Our public health team is working intensively to investigate the case, identify close contacts, and coordinate with our medical and community partners to protect public health,” said Dr. Greg Stern, Whatcom County Health Officer, in a statement.

“We are particularly thankful for the Whatcom County medical community, which has been in close communication with us about evaluating specific patients and implementing evolving guidelines,” Stern said.

Despite the additional measures people are being asked to take after the first confirmed case, Wolpers said that the risk to the public was still relatively low, though increasing.

To become infected by the virus that causes COVID-19, he said that people have to be in close contact with someone who is sick with the illness. That’s someone who lives in the same home, is caring for someone who is sick, is within six feet of someone sick with COVID-19 for about 10 minutes, or is in direct contact with respiratory droplets from someone who is ill.

Otherwise, you’re at low risk for infection, Wolpers said.

Health recommendations

So what should Whatcom County residents do now?

“We know that this is a difficult time for our community and these recommendations will significantly impact our daily lives,” Stern said in a statement. “The decision to make these recommendations was made based on the best public health science, which tells us that these actions are needed to reduce further transmission of disease in our area.”

The steps people are being asked to take are based on the increasing risk of the spread of COVID-19, Whatcom public health officials said, and match similar recommendations made by other health departments in the region.

They include:

▪ People who are at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places where there are a lot of of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others. This includes concert venues, conventions, sporting events and crowded social gatherings.

People who are at higher risk include those who are older than 60; have underlying health conditions that include heart disease, lung disease or diabetes; have weakened immune systems; and who are pregnant.

▪ As for public gatherings, officials said to avoid bringing together large groups of people — loosely defined as 10 to 50 people or more — if possible.

“Realistically there is no magic number,” Cindy Hollinsworth, the communicable disease and epidemiology manager for the health department, said Tuesday in the briefing. “The larger the group, the higher the risk of spreading illness.”

▪ Employees who can’t work from home should minimize their interaction with large groups of people.

Personal steps

County residents also are being asked to take these measures to help keep the respiratory illness from spreading:

▪ If you’re sick, stay home.

▪ If you’re sick with a cough and fever, don’t go back to work until 72 hours after your fever has gone away or seven days after the illness began, whichever is longer.

Employers are being urged to maximize their flexibility in sick leave benefits to accommodate these measures.

▪ If you’re sick with respiratory symptoms — coughing or sneezing — wear a mask when in public.

▪ Don’t go to emergency rooms or urgent care clinics if your illness is mild, so that health care providers can help those who have the most critical needs. Limiting unnecessary visits also protects health care workers and other patients from infection.

▪ Even if you are feeling well, avoid visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities or nursing homes. If you must go to those places, check the facility’s rules for visitors before showing up, don’t stay for too long, and keep at least six feet between you and patients at all times.

On Tuesday, Skagit County also reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a resident there.

Skagit County Public Health said the person was a woman in her 40s who was in isolation at home, adding that she appeared to have acquired COVID-19 through community transmission.

More than 118,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 4,200 deaths as of Tuesday evening, March 10, according to Johns Hopkins University. The United States has more than 972 confirmed cases with at least 28 deaths.

About coronavirus

COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019, is the name of the illness that first appeared in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, before spreading to other countries, including the U.S. It is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2.

The disease is spread through contact between people within 6 feet of each other — what’s referred to as close contact — especially through coughing and sneezing that expels respiratory droplets that land in the mouths or noses of people nearby.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it’s possible to catch COVID-19 by touching something that has the virus on it, and then touching your own face, “but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.”

Symptoms — cough, fever, difficulty breathing — may occur two days to two weeks after exposure. Although most of the cases have been mild, the disease is especially dangerous for the elderly and others with weaker immune systems.

City and county officials made the announcement during a special meeting, saying the declaration triggers the availability of state and federal emergency funds if needed.

Meanwhile, one local clinic said it had performed about three dozen coronavirus tests on Thursday alone.

County commissioners approved their declaration in the form of a resolution.

“This is a lever of government that we are pulling to receive government funds,” said Commissioner Vickie Baker.

Yakima Mayor Patricia Byers said the City Council will publicly announce its proclamation Friday.

Byers said the city will work with the county to address the outbreak.

Information updates will be handled by Yakima County Emergency Management and the Yakima Health District, commissioners said.

Under the proclamation, agencies will be able to bypass certain regulations and steps usually required for spending, contracting, borrowing and temporary hiring.

The two positive Yakima County test results came in Wednesday night, with the patients in their 60s and 80s, respectively. Each is recovering from the virus at home, according to the health district. They were not hospitalized.

Community transmission of the respiratory virus — which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic Wednesday — was “likely increasing at this time,” the Yakima Health District said.

Andre Fresco, executive director of the Yakima Health District, said social distancing is recommended. He said while the health district fully supports event cancellation, it was not mandating any.

The number of people tested in the county was not immediately available.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2, which is part of the same family as the flu and common cold. Primary symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. These usually appear two to 14 days after exposures.

Most people experience only mild symptoms. But some people develop more severe symptoms like pneumonia, which can be fatal. This is most common in those with preexisting conditions.

Two confirmed cases

The two patients with confirmed cases of the coronavirus were identified after coming in contact with a woman from Kittitas County who tested positive, as announced March 7. The woman attended an event at the Yakima Square & Round Dance Center in Moxee.

The eight people potentially exposed were self-isolated and tested for the virus. Two results came back positive, five came back negative and the last test is still awaiting results.

The district intends to contact individuals identified as having been in close contact with the two patients.

“While these are the first confirmed cases in our county, community transmission of COVID-19 is likely increasing at this time,” Teresa Everson, a health officer at the health district, said in the release. “As we see the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continue to increase in Yakima County and across the state in the next few weeks, it is important for everyone who feels sick, in any way, to stay home.”

The patients are among at least 457 confirmed cases statewide Thursday, according to the state Department of Health. The number climbed from 366 Wednesday. There had been 31 deaths as of Thursday.

Local scene

Fresco of the health district said it was difficult to determine the number of labs available in the county because there were several commercial labs now testing for the virus. He emphasized that the area was fully supplied with test kids, but could not provide the number.

Primary care providers throughout the county are able to conduct coronavirus testing, but individuals who show mild symptoms are advised to stay home and take care of themselves — there’s no vaccine and limited hospital capacity.

There were at least two commercial labs able to process the tests in Yakima County as of Thursday, according to reports from local medical experts.

Community Health of Central Washington’s network has tested “a handful of people,” while Yakima Neighborhood Health Services declined to provide a number. The Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, which launched its own testing lab last week, tested about three dozen patients Thursday alone.

It’s unclear how many people have been tested countywide.

Lori Kelley, Farm Workers’ senior director of quality and patient safety, emphasized that all patients were welcome regardless of ability to pay or citizenship status. She asked that patients call ahead so the network could take potential coronavirus cases through separate doors or meet them to avoid infecting healthy patients.

Individuals are advised to stay home and self-isolate if they show symptoms, unless conditions grow serious — such as shortness of breath or trouble breathing, said Dr. Michael Schaffrinna, chief medical officer of Community Health of Central Washington.

“If you’re sick, stay home because testing is not going to change what we do with you,” he said, emphasizing that there’s no treatment for the virus.

What’s more, he said, the test has a high rate of false negatives in patients who show mild symptoms, which is the most common experience — meaning they could be falsely reassured that they don’t have the virus, and continue transmitting it if not in isolation.

The best protection against the spread of the virus is to practice diligent hygiene, frequently disinfect surfaces and stay home when sick, Kelley said.

“Certainly we’re all one community and this affects all of us, so we want to be sure we’re putting the word out to everyone in the spirit of creating a culture of health for our community,” she said.

Moving forward

Local health experts are continuing to plan in response to the arrival of the virus.

Asked if the former Astria Regional Hospital building might be used to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 or to host medical providers, an Astria Health official said the organization had a meeting scheduled with local officials next week “to discuss possible uses of the closed facility.”

CHCW’s Yakima Pediatrics is launching a car-side triage to evaluate children Friday morning in response to a high volume of calls that outpace in-clinic capacity, said Schaffrinna. The services will allow providers to assess children and determine appropriate care, including potential coronavirus testing, he said.

“It’s not a matter of if, but when we offer that at each of our sites,” he said of car-side services.

Yakima Neighborhood Health Services operated as usual, according to communication director Leah Ward.

“The person-to-person spread modeled by the CDC World Health Organization indicates that extensive loss of life and or serious illness or disability is threatened imminently in all of West Virginia because of the transmission of the coronavirus.”

“COVID-19 poses an immediate danger to public safety,” the declaration states.

“To this point, what we’ve done is encouraged the public to stay away and to call,” Commissioner Mark Scott said. “We’ve got notices posted throughout the courthouse that states that if you have any business to please call in advance to see if it’s something that can be handled over the phone or through online services instead of entering the courthouse, and by and large, I think that has been heeded.”

Romenesko has declared a public health emergency in the county in an effort to guard against the spread of COVID-19, also known as coronavirus.

As of this Friday evening, March 13, there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Calumet County; however, multiple cases have now been reported in neighboring counties, including Fond du Lac and Sheboygan, as well as other communities throughout the state. Because of this, county officials are proactively trying to minimize the effects of the virus locally.

Calumet County’s action follows Governor Tony Evers’s recent statewide emergency declaration.

The county administrator is recommending the following preventive guidelines for individuals, businesses, and organizations:

• People at higher risk are encouraged to stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible. Higher risk individuals include people 60 and over; people with underlying health conditions including heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes; and people with weakened immune systems.

• Visitors will be restricted from the Calumet County Jail.

• Per Wisconsin Department of Health Services, organizers of public gatherings with at least 250 people are recommended to cancel their events; however, many are adhering to a smaller threshold of 50 or more people to reduce opportunities for person-to-person virus transmission.

• Nonessential travel for all individuals is discouraged. Those planning trips should consider the risks versus the benefits, not only to themselves, but to more vulnerable populations.

STURGEON BAY - Door County leaders determined COVID-19 to be a public health emergency due to the risk to residents and the county's function.

The emergency declaration said the pandemic — if it reaches the area, as no cases have been detected in Door County yet — could impair transportation, food or fuel supplies, medical care, fire, health or police protection and other vital services and establishments.

Another key concern is the impact the virus could have on the summer's tourist season. At a recent Egg Harbor village plan commission meeting, several people remarked ""we don't know if we'll even have a tourist season.""

The summer brings in thousands of tourists to the area, and millions of the dollars to the county's economy, but people fear the pandemic will still be in full force as the weather warms, prohibiting visitors.

Declaring the state of emergency means the county will make it a priority to provide necessary resources to combat the pandemic.

Both the U.S. and Wisconsin declared a public health emergency last week.

Door County also implemented two temporary administrative orders. One grants employees impacted by COVID-19 additional paid time-off days. Parents of children attending any of the county schools — all of which are closed until April 6 under state orders — could take extra days off for this reason.

The other, the Employee Travel Administrative Order, restricts local government employees from traveling out-of-state. The county advised employees to cancel out-of-state trips. Employees returning from traveling must self-quarantine and stay away from their work site for 14 days.

If people travel out-of state before midnight on Wednesday, they can use extra work leave hours granted under the original ordinance in order to isolate. But if they travel after they date, they cannot use additional work leave hours but can work remotely if an employer grants permission.

Public safety employees are not covered by the travel order. The order urged meetings and other events be held virtually whenever possible to practice social distancing. Both are subject to change and will be lifted as the pandemic improves.

The County Board will hold an emergency meeting at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, at which time county leaders will provide more updates, according to County Administrator Ken Pabich.

KEWAUNEE - With the number of COVID-19 cases increasing steadily across the state, Kewaunee's County Board declared a public health emergency effective immediately at its regularly scheduled Tuesday night meeting.

The board passed a resolution declaring the emergency 15-0 with five supervisors absent.

The emergency gives the board chairman — currently Robert Weidner, who is not seeking re-election in the April 7 election — and County Administrator Scott Feldt ""... the general authority to order, subject to ratification if practicable, whatever is necessary and expedient for the health, safety, protection, and welfare of persons and property within Kewaunee County in the emergency.""

Feldt said that means he and the board chairman can make decisions without getting approval from a county committee or the board regarding county operations related to the pandemic and resulting restrictions on groups of people getting together mandated by the state. He said it doesn't extend to decisions on what otherwise would be standard county business.

""It could be a variety of different things,"" Feldt said. ""You could be dealing with any type of employee pay issues (if county services close or limit hours), closure of offices.""

Any measures that deal more directly with public health would be made in consultation with county Public Health Department Director Cindy Kinnard, Feldt said.

Feldt said there are no specific plans to enact such measures as of Wednesday morning. He noted any emergency decisions must be enacted in writing and published.

Kewaunee County had no confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Wednesday morning. Kinnard said at the board meeting that ""numerous"" tests had been conducted on residents, although 10 or 12 test results are pending.

Although exploration for a possible mine by Badger Minerals would be in southern Oneida County, just north of Langlade County, the concern is the possible pollution of the Wolf River, which runs through Langlade County and eventually empties into Lake Michigan.

The resolution calls upon the State Legislature and Governor to repeal Wisconsin Act 134, which streamlined the mining permitting process.

In a second resolution, the board unanimously passed a declaration of a state of emergency in Langlade County in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The declaration suspends governing rules and gives authority to a “Unified Command,” which includes the County Board Chairman, the County Manager, and the Public Health Director.

The resolution states that the Unified Command is authorized to do whatever is necessary for the health, safety and protection of the county’s citizens in coordination with State and Federal authorities.",19575,NA

County Board Chairman Paul Bednarek had signed the declaration two days earlier on March 17, proclaiming a state of emergency through July 17 enabling the county “to employ and expend all available resources to protect the health, safety and welfare of persons and property in Oconto County.”

The vote was 24-0 to ratify Bednarek’s action, with seven supervisors not in attendance, in a meeting that was moved from the board chambers at the Oconto County Courthouse to the more spacious conference room at the adjacent Law Enforcement Center.

The board also passed a variety of more routine business items, including the election of Brandon Hytinen as the county’s new highway commissioner. Hytinen has been assistant highway commissioner under Pat Scanlan, who last month announced his retirement from the position effective April 3.

Salaries were set for the next four-year terms of the county clerk, register of deeds and treasurer, who will be elected in the November election.

The resolution – approved 23-1 with Supervisor Gary Frank dissenting – provides a 6.8% increase over the incumbents’ current salaries to $62,010 in 2021, followed by 2% annual raises for the next three years to $70,296.01 in 2024.

The board did postpone action on resolutions related to the closeout of the county Revolving Loan Fund and applications for two related Community Development Block Grant projects.",37318,NA
